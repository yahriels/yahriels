I am making a research poster that is based on the same project as this document here:{https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Workspace/ProjectNarrative_VeHROC%20v3.pdf} with this following information:{Research Question: Can VeHROC, a novel therapy combining HROC and VNS, more effectively improve recovery of hindlimb function compared to HROC or VNS alone in a rat model of chronic incomplete SCI?
Background: SCI is a prevalent condition with limited treatment options, imposing a significant burden on patients. Spasticity is a common and debilitating symptom of SCI, resulting from loss of inhibitory input from the brain to the spinal cord. Vagus Nerve Stimulation-enhanced H-reflex Operant Conditioning (VeHROC))  combines HROC and VNS to enhance recovery after SCI. HROC directs plasticity in specific spinal circuits, while VNS enhances these effects by increasing plasticity in the CNS to reduce spasticity.
Preclinical Observational Study (Simulated Data):Evaluating the efficacy of VeHROC to improve locomotion in a clinically relevant rat model of incomplete SCI. A Cohort Study Design with subjects exposed to VNS and SHAM.
Sampling Method : Stratified Random Sampling to ensure each subgroup is well represented.
Variables (X&Y) and Controls: Independent:
VNS Treatment (Ordinal)
HROC Therapy (Categorical)
Negative Control:
Trials with no VNS (SHAM).
Dependent:
H-Reflex Size/Amplitude (Continuous Numeric)
Positive Control:
HROC Therapy
Replicates: Animals are biological replicates of each other
Hypothesis: Hypothesis: We hypothesize that VNS can enhance the spinal conditioning effects of HROC to improve functional recovery after SPI. (Significantly alter H-Reflex Amplitude)
Null Hypothesis: VNS does not enhance the effects of HROC on spinal conditioning; there is no difference in H-reflex amplitude changes between groups with and without VNS.
Alternative Hypothesis: VNS enhances the effects of HROC on spinal conditioning, leading to greater changes in H-reflex amplitude.
Methods: Rats dynamically allocated into one of 4 groups:
- HROC only: When EMG activity falls within the target range, the tibial nerve cuff stimulus elicits an M response and an H-reflex. IF the H-Reflex size is within a target range, the rat receives food pellet reward.
- VNS only: receives the same handling as HROC only group, but with brief VNS bursts delivered on a schedule that is yoked to the HROC group’s successful trials. 
- VNS + HROC: Identical procedures to the HROC only group, but with 0.5-second burst of VNS administered with each food pellet reward during successful HROC trial. 
- SCI only: Does not receive any HROC or VNS. 
Assumption Checks: Normal distribution of H-reflex responses, Stable EMG baseline, Consistent-reliable VNS application //Normality, Independence, Homogeneity of Variance.
Discussion: VeHROC is an innovative therapeutic strategy that merges two clinically significant interventions: HROC and VNS. This combined approach aims to overcome limitations of each therapy individually and maximize post-SCI recovery. VeHROC is anticipated to improve spinal reflex conditioning and enhance locomotor recovery in rats, supporting the hypothesis that VNS can amplify the spinal conditioning effects of HROC for better functional outcomes after SCI. The study employs a rat model of SCI that closely resembles human conditions, increasing the translational value of the results. If VeHROC proves to be safe and feasible in the pilot clinical trial, outcomes will guide the development of a larger randomized controlled trial.
Limitations: The therapeutic effects observed in the rat model may not fully translate to human applications. Variability in injury severity and recovery could lead to inconsistent results. VNS-induced noise or artifact in EMG recordings signal could interfere with data accuracy.

 H-Reflex Operant Conditioning Project Project Notes :{
The Hoffmann reflex, also known as the H-reflex, is an electrical reflex that measures a muscle's response to stimulation of the afferent nerve: 
How it works
When a nerve is stimulated electrically, action potentials are sent to the spinal cord, which causes motoneurons to reach threshold and contract the extrafusal muscle. 
What it measures
The H-reflex is a measure of alpha motoneuron (αMN) excitability. It can be used to assess how the nervous system responds to a variety of conditions, including neurologic conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, pain, and exercise training. 
How it's measured
The H-reflex and any preceding M wave are usually measured electromyographically. The normal H-reflex latency ranges from 34 to 35 milliseconds, but depends on the patient's age, height, and limb length. 
How it's different from the spinal stretch reflex
The H-reflex is similar to the spinal stretch reflex, but it bypasses the muscle spindle. 

Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) is a peripheral reflex:
Explanation
The H-reflex is a peripheral reflex that's triggered by electrically stimulating a peripheral nerve. The stimulation activates the Ia fibers, which then activate the motoneurons in the spinal cord. This produces a muscle response, which is recorded using electromyography (EMG).
Purpose
The H-reflex is a diagnostic tool that measures the function of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It can be used to monitor the gray matter at the level of the reflex, and to estimate the conduction velocity of the monosynaptic reflex arc.
H-index and H/M ratio
The H-index and H/M ratio are two measurements used to analyze the H-reflex:
H-index: The relative latency between the H- and M-waves
H/M ratio: The ratio of the magnitudes of the maximum peak-to-peak H- and M-waves 





Additional Study Design Notes
Assumptions Check:
Normality: The distribution of H-reflex amplitude data should be normal.
Independence: Each measurement should be independent of the others.
Homogeneity of Variance: Variances between groups should be equal.

Background
Introduction to EMG and H-Reflex
Electromyography (EMG) records the electrical activity of muscles, providing insights into neuromuscular function.
The H-reflex (Hoffmann reflex) is a reflexive muscle response, elicited electrically, that serves as a measure of spinal cord excitability and motor pathway function.
H-Reflex Significance
H-reflex conditioning is used in research and clinical settings to understand plasticity in motor pathways.
It is especially relevant for studying motor control, rehabilitation, and adaptive responses in response to repetitive stimuli or training.
Goal of Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to examine changes in H-reflex response amplitude over time as a result of conditioning.
This involves statistical methods to determine if there is a significant change in H-reflex after conditioning protocols.

Hypothesis Testing for H-Reflex EMG Data
Hypothesis Setup
To determine if H-reflex conditioning has an effect, we formulate:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): H-reflex amplitude does not change with conditioning.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): H-reflex amplitude changes significantly due to conditioning.
Autocorrelation helps confirm repetitive patterns in time series data. We analyze auto-correlation to detect cycles or systematic responses in the H-reflex data.
Mean Comparison Tests:
We can use a paired t-test (or non-parametric tests if data distribution is non-normal) to compare pre- and post-conditioning H-reflex amplitudes.
Confidence Intervals:
Calculating confidence intervals for mean H-reflex amplitude helps validate the hypothesis test by showing the range within which the true mean likely falls.
Decision Criteria
Set a threshold p-value (commonly 0.05) for significance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding conditioning had a measurable effect.
"Decision: p < 0.05 to reject H₀."
"Conclusion: Conditioning effect on H-reflex if p-value is significant."


Hypothesis: We hypothesize that VNS can enhance the spinal conditioning effects of HROC to improve functional recovery after SPI. (Significantly alter H-Reflex Amplitude)

Question: Does the “clinically viable” h-reflex conditioning work? In the context of adapting the clinical motivation and models to a pre-clinical study and experimental paradigm.
Question
What effect does operant conditioning the soleus have on H-Reflex amplitudes over time?

Hypothesis
Conditioning of the soleus significantly alters the H-Reflex amplitude from baseline (pre) in post-conditioning (up/down).

Clinical Relevance: These findings highlight the potential for H-reflex conditioning in motor rehabilitation strategies and improving adaptive responses.
