Background: SCI is a prevalent condition with limited treatment options, imposing a significant burden on patients. Spasticity is a common and debilitating symptom of SCI, resulting from loss of inhibitory input from the brain to the spinal cord. Vagus Nerve Stimulation-enhanced H-reflex Operant Conditioning (VeHROC))  combines HROC and VNS to enhance recovery after SCI. HROC directs plasticity in specific spinal circuits, while VNS enhances these effects by increasing plasticity in the CNS to reduce spasticity.
Research Question: Can VeHROC, a novel therapy combining HROC and VNS, more effectively improve recovery of hindlimb function compared to HROC or VNS alone in a rat 
Evaluating the efficacy of VeHROC to improve locomotion in a clinically relevant rat model of incomplete SCI. A Cohort Study Design with subjects exposed to VNS and SHAM. 
Preclinical Observational Study (Simulated Data):Evaluating the efficacy of VeHROC to improve locomotion in a clinically relevant rat model of incomplete SCI. A Cohort Study Design with subjects exposed to VNS and SHAM.
Sampling Method : Stratified Random Sampling to ensure each subgroup is well represented.
Variables (X&Y) and Controls: Independent:
VNS Treatment (Ordinal)
HROC Therapy (Categorical)
Negative Control:
Trials with no VNS (SHAM).
Dependent:
H-Reflex Size/Amplitude (Continuous Numeric)
Positive Control:
HROC Therapy
Replicates: Animals are biological replicates of each other
Hypothesis: Hypothesis: We hypothesize that VNS can enhance the spinal conditioning effects of HROC to improve functional recovery after SPI. (Significantly alter H-Reflex Amplitude)
Null Hypothesis: VNS does not enhance the effects of HROC on spinal conditioning; there is no difference in H-reflex amplitude changes between groups with and without VNS.
Alternative Hypothesis: VNS enhances the effects of HROC on spinal conditioning, leading to greater changes in H-reflex amplitude.
Methods: Rats dynamically allocated into one of 4 groups:
- HROC only: When EMG activity falls within the target range, the tibial nerve cuff stimulus elicits an M response and an H-reflex. IF the H-Reflex size is within a target range, the rat receives food pellet reward.
- VNS only: receives the same handling as HROC only group, but with brief VNS bursts delivered on a schedule that is yoked to the HROC group’s successful trials. 
- VNS + HROC: Identical procedures to the HROC only group, but with 0.5-second burst of VNS administered with each food pellet reward during successful HROC trial. 
- SCI only: Does not receive any HROC or VNS. 
Assumption Checks: Normal distribution of H-reflex responses, Stable EMG baseline, Consistent-reliable VNS application //Normality, Independence, Homogeneity of Variance.
Discussion: VeHROC is an innovative therapeutic strategy that merges two clinically significant interventions: HROC and VNS. This combined approach aims to overcome limitations of each therapy individually and maximize post-SCI recovery. VeHROC is anticipated to improve spinal reflex conditioning and enhance locomotor recovery in rats, supporting the hypothesis that VNS can amplify the spinal conditioning effects of HROC for better functional outcomes after SCI. The study employs a rat model of SCI that closely resembles human conditions, increasing the translational value of the results. If VeHROC proves to be safe and feasible in the pilot clinical trial, outcomes will guide the development of a larger randomized controlled trial.
Limitations: The therapeutic effects observed in the rat model may not fully translate to human applications. Variability in injury severity and recovery could lead to inconsistent results. VNS-induced noise or artifact in EMG recordings signal could interfere with data accuracy.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that VNS can enhance the spinal conditioning effects of HROC to improve functional recovery after SPI. (Significantly alter H-Reflex Amplitude)

Question: Does the “clinically viable” h-reflex conditioning work? In the context of adapting the clinical motivation and models to a pre-clinical study and experimental paradigm.
Question
What effect does operant conditioning the soleus have on H-Reflex amplitudes over time?

Hypothesis
Conditioning of the soleus significantly alters the H-Reflex amplitude from baseline (pre) in post-conditioning (up/down).

Clinical Relevance: These findings highlight the potential for H-reflex conditioning in motor rehabilitation strategies and improving adaptive responses.

EXECUTIVE TASK: Help me Design Experiments for this reserach topic and project.

I am designing experiments that are based on the research project narrative of this document here:{https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Workspace/ProjectNarrative_VeHROC%20v3.pdf} with this following information:{Research Question: Can VeHROC, a novel therapy combining HROC and VNS, more effectively improve recovery of hindlimb function compared to HROC or VNS alone in a rat model of chronic incomplete SCI?

This project and set of experiments is inspired on the pre-clinical model of this paper:
