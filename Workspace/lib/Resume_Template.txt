The Order of The Engineer
the Engineering Student Council will host the Order of the Engineer for graduating engineering students, where they can take an oath of ethics in their engineering careers. Each participant will also receive a ring to commemorate their commitment. This is conducted during your final semester of enrollment for graduating engineering students and graduate students. 
The Order of the Engineer was initiated in the United States to foster a spirit of pride and responsibility in the engineering profession, bridge the gap between training and experience, and present a visible symbol identifying the engineer to the public.
Order of the Engineer fosters the understanding that being a licensed professional engineer means more than just holding a certificate and possessing technical competence. It is a commitment to hold the public health, safety, and welfare above all other considerations.
