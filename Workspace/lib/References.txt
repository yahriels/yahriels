Subject: Request for Letters of Recommendation - Final PhD Program Selections

Dear [Recommender's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. Can you believe it?! The time has finally come for me to take AN IMMENSE LEAP and put myself out into the world! I couldn't have gotten here without your esteemed guidance and support.

In two weeks, December 16th, I will graduate with a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from Iowa State University ('23), and I am now in the process of submitting my applications for admission to Various Prestigous PhD programs (See Graduate Programs Selections Below). Given your expertise and my admiration for your work, I am reaching out to kindly request if you would be willing to provide recommendation letters for the selected applications.

During my research under your guidance, I gained invaluable insights into experimental techniques, hardware-software components, and the complexities of MEMS nanocomposites. The experience significantly shaped my academic and research journey, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of continuing my education at the world class level and transforming the scientific world as we now it!

I have thoroughly researched my intellectual interests and found interest in Health Sciences & Technology (Mental Health Innovation), especially in the intersection of the fractaliity of nature (Mandelbrot Set & Fractal Mathematics) and identifying neuroanotomical features of global mental health disorders (Neurobiology & Chaos Theory). Your pioneering spirit fueled my aspirations to pursue the greatest global health challenges in the field of neuroscience and biomedical data science.

If you agree to support my application, I will provide any necessary information, including my resume, transcripts, and a summary of my proposed materials. The deadline for submission of recommendation letters vary depending on the program selection srtarting from [12/01/23 - 12/15/23].

I understand the demands on your time and truly appreciate your consideration of this request. Your support will undoubtedly enhance my application, and I am confident that your endorsement will significantly contribute to my chances of acceptance into these programs.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working with you again and contributing to the vibrant scientific community at the highest-level. Please let me know if I can be of assistance in any way!

Best regards,

Yahriel Salinas-Reyes

P.S. Fun Fact: This New Years I will be in México (visiting my homeland/family for the first time), when I return to the U.S. in 2024 I will officially have triple citizenship status of the U.S., El Salvador, and México!
