STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
Your Statement of Purpose should be no more than one page, double-spaced, in 12 point font. It should provide the review committee with insight on your past experiences and your future career objectives and answer the question - Why did you choose Stevens and the program that you are applying to?

When crafting your Statement, it may be beneficial to consider your past, present, and future.
Past: What have your educational and work experiences been thus far? What has led you to this point in your life?
Present: Why are you applying to graduate school? Why are you choosing this institution? Why are you choosing this program?
Future: What are your career goals? How will your degree from Stevens help you to attain them?
If you are applying to a Ph.D. program, you might want to discuss your research interests and how they align with the work of the current faculty.
