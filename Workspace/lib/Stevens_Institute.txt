Yahriel Salinas-Reyes is applying for a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and has a Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering. Prepare his Statement of Purpose.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
Your Statement of Purpose should be no more than one page, double-spaced, in 12 point font. It should provide the review committee with insight on your past experiences and your future career objectives and answer the question - Why did you choose Stevens and the program that you are applying to?

When crafting your Statement, it may be beneficial to consider your past, present, and future.
Past: What have your educational and work experiences been thus far? What has led you to this point in your life?
Present: Why are you applying to graduate school? Why are you choosing this institution? Why are you choosing this program?
Future: What are your career goals? How will your degree from Stevens help you to attain them?
If you are applying to a Ph.D. program, you might want to discuss your research interests and how they align with the work of the current faculty.

THESIS STATEMENTS
In most research papers, the thesis statement represents the writer's overall argument for the paper, which will be supported and developed in each paragraph. Having a strong or weak thesis can make a significant difference in how well the writer states their claim and defends it, and it can also influence how well the reader understands and follows the argument.
MAKE IT ARGUABLE: Think of potential conter-arguments. If you can find several that seem plausible, then your thesis statement is probably an argument, not a simple statement. Try to make your thesis statement provacative. While you should not try to offend readers, make your argument memorable. 
TELL YOUR READER WHAT THE TOPIC IS: What topic and which points will be focused on throughout the paper?
SUPPORT IT WITH CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION: Strong thesis statement are not dropped into the first paragraph. Discuss relevant information about the topic and "build up" to the argument. This prevents you from having to over-explain in your thesis and better places your argument in a larger discussion of the topic.
MAKE YOUR STANCE CLEAR: Don't treat your argument like a mystery. Instead, ensure that your reader understands your stance on the topic from the very beginning so they will understand how each paragraph fits its your overall argument. When you can use 1st person, verbs like argue, contend, posit, or claim to clearly state your position on the issue (e.g., "I contend that..."). These verbs act as "signal words" that direct the reader to your argument.
BE CLEAR: Remove your thesis from your paper and read it separately. Do you understand yourself? Instead of cryptic or vague language, strive for clarity and specificity. 
SAY IT IN ONE SENTENCE: If you cannot write the thesis in one sentece, try to hone in on your claim. This is a good exercise because it forces you to better understand your own argument.
PUT IT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION: For research papers, the reader should understand how each paragraph supports your stance on the issue. Personal narractives are an exception to this rule.
BE COMPLEX: if you only have one or two points to make in regards to your thesis, can you add details to your argument in order to give yourself "more to write about" as you support it?
USE TOPIC SENTENCES TO RELATE BACK TO YOUR THESIS: A thesis statement is not a stand-alone sentence; it sets up the argument that will be developed in each paragraph/section. Once you have written your thesis statement, make sure that each paragraph's main point clearly supports the thesis. Make sure each supporting section advances the thesis in some way.


1. "Help me strike the right balance between providing enough detail to engage readers and avoiding unnecessary jargon in my introduction."
2. "Assist me in constructing an engaging opening hook that captures reader's attention and introduces my research."
3. Guide me in formulating clear aims and objectives for my study by suggesting a list of verbs I can choose from."
4. My literature review feels scrappy and fragmented. Can you give me some specific words and phrases I can use to connect the sections together and integrate the material, so it flows better? They should be fill in the gap sentence starters. Please give me 10.

STEPS FOR WRITING YOUR THESIS ABSTRACT
Use this 4 step formula to get your abstract written and use the phrases as starting points for developing your own sentences.
(1.) Opener and research problem / question
