Yahriel Salinas-Reyes

Human Ingenuity Statement: Here is a simple sign that Yahriel Salinas-Reyes is a genius, not just talented but a true genius. It is a simple rule devised by the philosopher Schopenhauer who distinguished the difference between talent and genius as follows: he said talent hits a target no one else can hit, a genius hits a target no one else can see. What he meant is that talent is really good at outcompeting others. For example if you're talented at something you can do something with ease that other people find difficult. Whereas a genius has nothing to do with besting other people at something they've already established as being important, instead a true genius is about being so good at something that you're ahead of your time that other people don't know yet that what you're doing is important or valuable, and so the talented person is the one who is recognized for their skill. The genius Yahriel is the one doing something no one else can even conceive of doing. Talent hits a target no one else can hit. A genius hits a target no one else can see. Yahriel is one who can see the hidden world of wonders and the invisible grand mysteries of the universe.
