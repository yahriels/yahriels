I think the idea was to translate some theory from piezo-electric energy harvesters to piezo-resistive ones.  This may have broader scientific interest a fit into the scope of this special issue.



As I saw this call for paper, I believe our works are deeply aligned with: 

CALL FOR PAPERS: Phase-change Materials and Their Applications
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SPECIAL TOPIC
A better understanding of phase-change materials facilitates optimal design, and their strategic integration in devices/systems helps reach new theoretical limits that are intrinsic to more traditional materials. This broad field encompasses multiple phenomena and different operational principles, which have been cleverly used for demonstrating technological advantages. However, the underlying physics of some phase-change materials is yet to be fully understood, casting a shadow on the full potential of devices/systems relying on phase-change materials. This special topic welcomes contributions that demonstrate the integration of phase-change materials into sensors and actuators that exploit their multifunctionality, and fundamental studies that help understand them

Topics covered include, but are not limited to:

Theory, modeling and simulation of solid-to-solid phase transitions
Implementation of phase-change materials in memory devices and systems
Advances in thermal energy and storage
Integration of phase-change materials in energy efficient buildings and smart textiles
Dielectrics, Ferroelectrics, and multiferroics
Applications and integration of solid-liquid phase transitions
Thin films, interfaces, and surfaces
- Theory, modeling and simulation of solid-to-solid phase transitions
- Implementation of phase-change materials in memory devices and systems
- Integration of phase-change materials in energy efficient buildings and smart textiles
- Dielectrics, Ferroelectrics, and multiferroics
- Applications and integration of solid-liquid phase transitions
- Thin films, interfaces, and surfaces

In preparing a manuscript for this Special Topic: Phase-change Materials And Their Applications may be straightforward given our past work and discussions.

You are interested interested in submitting a manuscript for this journal. I Believe we may have a good chance for this journal as I believe our reseach thus far will fit within this special topic and help us develop a solid-straightforward physics problem and lead to novel findings. 

Yes, that sounds correct about translating theory the analysis of the piezoelectric harvesters to modeling piezoresistive theory as the main theme of the paper. 

As you said, we would be relying on Dr. Thuo's past experimentation on phase-change materials and their applications (1A) https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Manuscript_Stuff/Background%20Lit/(1A)Stabilization%20of%20Undercooled%20Metals%20via%20Passivating%20Oxide%20Layers.pdf

(2B) https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Manuscript_Stuff/Background%20Lit/(2B)Sensing%20Kirigami.pdf. I foresee this to embody the materials and methods section.

(2B) https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Manuscript_Stuff/Background%20Lit/(2B)Sensing%20Kirigami.pdf.

Thus, this should lead the paper into a discussion of the Special Topic:
"This Special Topic welcomes contributions that demonstrate the integration of phase-change materials into sensors and actuators that exploit their multifunctionality, and fundamental studies that help understand them."

I will start to develop a pseudo-abstract for us to review and an outline for the paper.

My literature review feels scrappy and fragmented. Can you give me some specific words and phrases I can use to connect the sections together and integrate the material, so it flows better? They should be fill in the gap sentence starters. Please give me 10.

THESIS STATEMENTS
In most research papers, the thesis statement represents the writer's overall argument for the paper, which will be supported and developed in each paragraph. Having a strong or weak thesis can make a significant difference in how well the writer states their claim and defends it, and it can also influence how well the reader understands and follows the argument.
MAKE IT ARGUABLE: Think of potential conter-arguments. If you can find several that seem plausible, then your thesis statement is probably an argument, not a simple statement. Try to make your thesis statement provacative. While you should not try to offend readers, make your argument memorable. 
TELL YOUR READER WHAT THE TOPIC IS: What topic and which points will be focused on throughout the paper?
SUPPORT IT WITH CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION: Strong thesis statement are not dropped into the first paragraph. Discuss relevant information about the topic and "build up" to the argument. This prevents you from having to over-explain in your thesis and better places your argument in a larger discussion of the topic.
MAKE YOUR STANCE CLEAR: Don't treat your argument like a mystery. Instead, ensure that your reader understands your stance on the topic from the very beginning so they will understand how each paragraph fits its your overall argument. When you can use 1st person, verbs like argue, contend, posit, or claim to clearly state your position on the issue (e.g., "I contend that..."). These verbs act as "signal words" that direct the reader to your argument.
BE CLEAR: Remove your thesis from your paper and read it separately. Do you understand yourself? Instead of cryptic or vague language, strive for clarity and specificity. 
SAY IT IN ONE SENTENCE: If you cannot write the thesis in one sentece, try to hone in on your claim. This is a good exercise because it forces you to better understand your own argument.
PUT IT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION: For research papers, the reader should understand how each paragraph supports your stance on the issue. Personal narractives are an exception to this rule.
BE COMPLEX: if you only have one or two points to make in regards to your thesis, can you add details to your argument in order to give yourself "more to write about" as you support it?
USE TOPIC SENTENCES TO RELATE BACK TO YOUR THESIS: A thesis statement is not a stand-alone sentence; it sets up the argument that will be developed in each paragraph/section. Once you have written your thesis statement, make sure that each paragraph's main point clearly supports the thesis. Make sure each supporting section advances the thesis in some way.

RESEARCH PAPER WRITING PROCESS KEY SECTIONS:
1. Abstract: The abstract (150-250 words) summarizes your research paper, including the problem, method, findings, and conclusions in plain language.
2. Introduction: This section establishes context, significance, and objectives. Start with an engaging opening, provide background, state your thesis, and discuss broader implications.
3. Body: Present research, arguments, and evidence systematically. Align with your thesis, use topic sentences, support with data, and maintain a formal tone.
4. Summarize key points and broader findings" significance. Avoid new information; emphasize implications.
