SPARCnet RaMP: Training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists to collaboratively address species responses to climate change
We are excited to announce our new National Science Foundation (NSF) Research and Mentoring for Postbaccalaureates (RaMP) in Biological Sciences award. Our program, RaMP: Training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists to collaboratively address species responses to climate change with SPARCnet will use SPARCnet methods to lead three cohorts of 8-10 postbaccalaureate researchers in paid, mentored research with SPARCnet collaborators. Postbaccs will have the opportunity to build their science skills through independent and team-based research projects, professional development, and networking opportunities.

SPARCnet RaMP: Amphibian responses to climate change
BRIDGEWATER STATE UNIVERSITY
Jul 2024 - Jun 2025
Award Title
RaMP: Training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists to collaboratively address species responses to climate change with SPARCnet

Overview
The Salamander Population and Adaptation Research Collaboration Network (SPARCnet) RaMP program is recruiting a diverse cohort of recent college graduates for a paid, year-long research and professional development mentorship program. Mentees will work in a mentor-mentee team to carry out individual and collaborative research projects investigating patterns and predicting responses of amphibians to global change. Teams will be based at locations across the eastern and midwestern states, within the range of the focal salamander species, the eastern red-backed salamander. The SPARCnet RaMP program will provide professional development and career exploration for mentees to gain placement in career or graduate school opportunities, with the goal of expanding participation in the scientific workforce.


Eligibility Requirements
Applicants must be United States citizens or permanent residents. Target applicants are ​​post-baccalaureates (completed Bachelor’s degree by start of program on July 1st, 2024) who are interested in research. Target applicants may not have had strong research experiences as undergraduates but are interested in a career in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM).

Core Project Research Questions:
Population Ecology: How do salamander population structure and dynamics differ across different climatic conditions within the species’ range?
Physiological Ecology: What is the relationship between environmental conditions and the growth and condition of individual salamanders?
Behavioral Ecology: How do climatic conditions affect behavior of surface activity by salamanders and do these relationships vary among locations?
Tailored Project Themes & Example Research Questions:
Behavior, e.g., how does salamander foraging behavior and surface activity vary with changes in climatic variables?
Physiology, Morphology, and Genetics, e.g., does salamander physiology vary with environmental correlates among populations?
Habitat, e.g., how do abiotic components, like temperature, moisture, or pH, of study plots correlate with local salamander densities?
Prediction and Modeling, e.g., how are future climates predicted to affect future distributions of salamanders?
Human Dimensions, e.g., how can we support effective science communication and engagement of SPARCnet research with land managers?
