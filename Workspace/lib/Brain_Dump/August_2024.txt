Keep Working on Powerpoint Presentation

- Talk to Isabella about getting rats for pilot experiments

Key Papers:
- A limited range of vagus nerve stimulation intensities produce motor cortex reorganization when delivered during training: {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432820304046?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8bb547432c71a915}
---- "However, the failure of higher intensity stimulation to enhance plasticity suggests that over-activation of these networks also prevents plasticity."
- Parametric characterization of the rat Hering-Breuer reflex evoked with implanted and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation: {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014488620300510}
- A new electrode configuration for recording electromyographic activity in behaving mice: {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027005001159}
- Behaviorally Selective Engagement of Short-Latency Effector Pathways by Motor Cortex: {https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30594-9} 


Mechanisms: alpha recepters blocking plasticity has been done somewhat, what if we do experiments to see if beta recepters block or promote plasticity and how does it interact with alpha. 

Question: Can we monitor respiration & detect VNS activity?
Long-term: Personalization of therapy (Parameter Set) unique to each patients for recovery after SPI


Artifact: *Unwanted natural noise of the wave form that saturates the signal from the recording channel*
-> Use H-Reflex to define threshold to set frequency and amplitude range
How bad does the artifact signal bleed through?
