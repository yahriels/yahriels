General Idea: Record  diaphram respiration while rats are awake to monitor amplitude (and to eventually perform with jaw experiments)
-> Use threshold of H-Reflex to set frequency and amplitude range (we also may use Myomatrix that provide 16 arrays)

Set-up dEMG recordings to monitor respiration and detect H-Reflex (while rat is awake)
Repurpose already existing Behavioral Testing Set-up (Jaw+VNS) for our experiments
Build system for Parameter EMG Cases (30 Hz, Amplitude Parameter Sweep)
Build system that can administer VNS and record dEMG at the same time



Mechanisms: alpha recepters blocking plasticity has been done somewhat, what if we do experiments to see if beta recepters block or promote plasticity and how does it interact with alpha. 


30 Hz Frequecy with Amplitude Sweep for EMG Recordings


Will be performing EMG Recordings and VNS at the same time.

Recordings are are stages 

Artifact: *Unwanted portion of the signal that saturates the signal from the recording channel*
