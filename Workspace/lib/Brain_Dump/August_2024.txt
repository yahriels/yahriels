General Idea: Record  diaphram respiration while rats are awake to monitor amplitude (and to eventually perform with jaw experiments)
-> Use threshold of H-Reflex to set frequency and amplitude range (we also may use Myomatrix that provide 16 arrays)

Set-up dEMG recordings to monitor respiration and detect H-Reflex (while rat is awake)
Repurpose already existing Behavioral Testing Set-up (Jaw+VNS) for our experiments
Build system for Parameter EMG Cases (30 Hz, Amplitude Parameter Sweep)
Build system that can administer VNS and record dEMG at the same time



Mechanisms: alpha recepters blocking plasticity has been done somewhat, what if we do experiments to see if beta recepters block or promote plasticity and how does it interact with alpha. 

Question: Can we monitor respiration & detect VNS activity?
Long-term: Personalization of therapy (Parameter Set) unique to each patients for recovery after SPI


Artifact: *Unwanted natural noise of the wave form that saturates the signal from the recording channel*
-> Use H-Reflex to define threshold to set frequency and amplitude range
How bad does the artifact signal bleed through?
