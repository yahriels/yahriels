General Idea: Record  diaphram respiration while rats are awake to monitor amplitude (and to eventually perform with jaw experiments)
-> Use threshold of H-Reflex to set frequency and amplitude range (we also may use Myomatrix that provide 16 arrays)


30 Hz Frequecy with Amplitude Sweep for EMG Recordings


Will be performing EMG Recordings and VNS at the same time.

Recordings are are stages 

Artifact: *Unwanted portion of the signal that saturates the signal from the recording channel*

Components
- Head plate
- Pre-Amp
- Stimulator
- Wave Form Generator
- Commutator
- DAQ
- 4 electrodes [2 for VNS][2 For dEMG]
- Collection of needed cords and connectors

Behavior Cases (8)
- Already Exists
- Jaw + VNS
- 5x Per week
- Behavior VNS post jaw pairings

Parameter EMG Cases (1 or 2)
- Needs to be built
- 1x per week
-
