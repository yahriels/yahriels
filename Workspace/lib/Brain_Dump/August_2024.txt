Week To do 
- Figure out how to make EMG electrodes
    - Electrode Configuration: {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027005001159}
    - Look through dEMG paper for length of wire from diaghram to headcap
- Get trained on Microconstruction and Surgeries
    - Need to get familiar with the Headcap and Cuff components
    - Need to start training on Bananas (Undergraduate Surgery Trainings)
- VNS and dEMG electrodes surgery and connection to Headcap
    - Follow-up with Jonathon Riley (Start experimentation 2-3 weeks tentatively)
    - Talk to Tanya about having her do the Surgeries
- Meet with Tanya  
    - EMG electrode wires, Surturing needle with eyehole, connectors
    - Microconstruction and Banana Trainings
    - Outsourcing VNS and dEMG Surgeries
