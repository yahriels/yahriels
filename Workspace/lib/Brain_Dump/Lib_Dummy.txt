Question Prompts:

I am having trouble understanding what the criterion for classifying a 'successful trial' and delivering a food reward to rats from Trial to Trial, and within trial of H-Reflex Operant Conditioning.

I am having trouble understanding what the criterion for classifying a 'successful trial' and delivering reward from Trial to Trial of H-Reflex Operant Conditioning.

The next section I am outlining is the VNS-enhcanced H-reflex conditioning section of my presentation.
Help me provide a transition from the last section:{
B.	Hyper-reflexive Spinal Reflexes ~ 1.20 minutes
Why do we care? 
-	“Spasticity is a common and debilitating consequence of upper motor neuron injury from conditions like stroke and spinal cord injury”
-	“Spasticity can significantly impair motor function, and patient's quality of life”
Setting: Do we have a way to target these disorders? (Spoiler…We don’t)
-	“This raises the question: Do we have ways to specifically target these other disorders where reflexes are abnormally high?” 
What is the conflict? Proposed opportunity? 
-	“The limitations of current approaches highlight the critical need to understand the mechanisms of spasticity and to develop more effective and targeted interventions that can address the underlying neural dysfunction” 
-	“It has been suggested that spasticity can be viewed as a form of maladaptive plasticity, implying that therapies aimed at inducing beneficial neural plasticity could be particularly relevant”

Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)


What are faculty looking
- Single Slide and the importance (spend a lot of time putting it together), and know everything you're putting on it
- How are you gonna process this data, complications, how to interpret, etc...
- What is the central DOGMA


The PI has an opporunity to make a statement, what the strengths are, weaknesses, etc.
