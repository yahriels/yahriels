Austin Bollinger	When a muscle activation occurs through electrical stimulas a response occurs and can be recorded using EMG electrodes. During this activation we can record motor units. Do motor units respond in different phases of the activation? 	Motor units response during stimulation or muscle activation occur at different phases of EMG. 	No	Yes	Motor Units that respond in M wave phase, Motor Units that respond in H-reflux phase, motor units that respond in both phases	Categorical	Electircal Stimulation Trials(constant stimulation, ramped stimulation, evoked max muscle contraction)	Categories of muscle motor units	Numerical 	Control Trials of constant stimulation, what changed in the ramped stimulation trials	Trial order was randimized 			8 human subjects		ANOVA

QE is Spring 2025
8:30 AM - 2:00 PM
Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research 
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)


What are faculty looking
- Single Slide and the importance (spend a lot of time putting it together), and know everything you're putting on it
- How are you gonna process this data, complications, how to interpret, etc...
- What is the central DOGMA


The PI has an opporunity to make a statement, what the strengths are, weaknesses, etc.
