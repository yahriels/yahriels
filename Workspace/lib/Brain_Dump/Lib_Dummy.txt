Challenges for investigating spasticity in mice
Compared to other aspects of the upper motor neuron syndrome or spasticity-relevant neurological disorders in general, the research output on spasticity in mice is minimal. There seems to be an experimental roadblock, which impedes further studies. We believe that there are three fundamental challenges for investigating spasticity in mice, which need to solved to generate reliable mouse models: 
1) a standardized neuroscore, e.g., based on behavioral assessments optimized for specific neurological disorder models, 
2) a standard protocol for the H-reflex measurement and analysis, and 
3) a better understanding of the common and differential roles of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts between mice and humans in (recovery of) motor control.

Establishment of SCI models
For SCI research, it is essential to establish an ideal animal model of SCI. Ideal models should meet the following conditions (Akhtar et al., 2008): 
(1) simulate damage that is similar to clinical SCI; 
(2) be controlled, reproducible, and stable; 
(3) involve a simple technique that is easy to study; 
(4) the equipment used to make a model is straightforward and quick to produce.

Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)


What are faculty looking
- Single Slide and the importance (spend a lot of time putting it together), and know everything you're putting on it
- How are you gonna process this data, complications, how to interpret, etc...
- What is the central DOGMA


The PI has an opporunity to make a statement, what the strengths are, weaknesses, etc.
