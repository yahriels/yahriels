Description Prompt:
I am making a very basic description section to "describe the broad area of research" and my research is on Vagus Nerve Stimulation-Enhanced H-Reflex Operant Conditioning (VeHROC). So far, I have vaguely described that H-Reflex Operant Conditioning directs plasticity to specific spinal circuits, and the paired VNS increases plasticity in the Central Nervous System. and that when pair VNS with HROC it increases functional recovery of patients with Spinal Cord Injury and/or Spasticity/Maladaptive behaviors. Now I am wondering what are some good bullet points to help me guide and introduce this discussion based on these notes:{Motivation/Introduction Ideas
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is prevalent and lacks effective therapeutic interventions
Maybe next, Spasticity/Heksors/(mal)Adaptive Behaviors?
} and please order them in a way that makes a comprehensive and digestible story WITH ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

Concept Diagram Prompt:
I am making a very basic concept diagram section to "Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research" and my research is on Vagus Nerve Stimulation-Enhanced H-Reflex Operant Conditioning (VeHROC). So far, I have vaguely described that we are conducting experiments in rats and are interested in studying and operantly conditioning the h-reflex, as well as the kind/nature of the induced injury (for the injury model), general timeline/protocol of the experiments, and that we have 4 groups represented (SCI Only, HROC only, SHAM, and VeHROC).  Now I am wondering what are some good bullet points to help me guide and introduce this discussion based on these notes:{} and please order them in a way that makes a comprehensive and digestible story WITH ONLY THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

Now I am wondering how to make a workflow of the procedure in preparing rats for experiments, and then running and completing the experiments such as this flow diagram (Habituation -> Implantation -> Recovery -> Training - > HROC/VNS -> ...)

Backlog
- Read Dr. Meyers' Dissertations: {https://www.proquest.com/pqdtlocal1006281/docview/2087776469/E4E1D789F8AE458EPQ/1?accountid=7120&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses}
- then Ch. 16-17
- Read VNS Papers from Dr. Hays and Dr. Kilgard

PROJECT AIMS
Aim 1: Clinical Viability/Efficacy of HROC?
Aim 2: Can VNS Enhance HROC and Replace Food Pellet Reward?

Challenges for investigating spasticity in mice
Compared to other aspects of the upper motor neuron syndrome or spasticity-relevant neurological disorders in general, the research output on spasticity in mice is minimal. There seems to be an experimental roadblock, which impedes further studies. We believe that there are three fundamental challenges for investigating spasticity in mice, which need to solved to generate reliable mouse models: 
1) a standardized neuroscore, e.g., based on behavioral assessments optimized for specific neurological disorder models, 
2) a standard protocol for the H-reflex measurement and analysis, and 
3) a better understanding of the common and differential roles of the pyramidal and extrapyramidal tracts between mice and humans in (recovery of) motor control.

Establishment of SCI models
For SCI research, it is essential to establish an ideal animal model of SCI. Ideal models should meet the following conditions (Akhtar et al., 2008): 
(1) simulate damage that is similar to clinical SCI; 
(2) be controlled, reproducible, and stable; 
(3) involve a simple technique that is easy to study; 
(4) the equipment used to make a model is straightforward and quick to produce.
