AWAKE BEHAVING ANIMAL RECORDING
CONCURRENT AND STIMULATING (THIS IS NEW)
SCALABLE SOLUTIONS
    - Cost Effective
    - Multiple (10x booths)
    - Open Source and Hardware/material Selection
    - LEAN system


Question
- What are you gonna do with the VNS only group, are you gonna food deprive them? 
We will, we are targeting this food reward response (like sound of food pellet dispenser) and can we replace that with VNS stimulation.


Stats?
- How are you gonna analyze it? Aside from M- and H- wave, how do we get the stats.
- Repeated Measures | Two-Way ANOVA (time and group) 
        - This is our question? Difference in the trajectories of each group over time, with only one change between groups?
        - At the final time point? What is the biggest change in different
            - 2 Sample T-Test
- We don't know what the effect size with VNS
    - So we can see the increase, on top of VNS
    - We can estimate our effect size 
        - Historical data from H-Reflex and VNS
            - Observe the variability, and see if we can draw the models together to estimate the effect size
- This pilot study's purpose to define our statistical power

- Take distrubition of day-to-day trials, then take the mean, then average it across all rats to get average and standard deviation.


Aim 3: How to do experimental design, and how to add in behavourial assessments, what are the measureable outcomes

- Behavourial Assessment: 
    - Ladder Run
    - Motion Capture (SYmmetry of Gait)
- Measureable Outcomes:

Question Prompts:


I am doing a presentation and am presenting my "Yahriel Salinas-Reyes Quad Chart" which is based on the "Project Narrative_VeROC" where spasticity is the main problem we are tackling as described in "spasticity.pdf". Now give me an overview of the main principles and topics I need to know, which in-depth descriptions, from "Neuro_Textbook_CH8,16-17.pdf" and how it relates to the rest of the project or presentation. And then give me some talking points I must hit in my presentation. 


I am having trouble understanding what the criterion for classifying a 'successful trial' and delivering a food reward to rats from Trial to Trial, and within trial of H-Reflex Operant Conditioning.

Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)


What are faculty looking
- Single Slide and the importance (spend a lot of time putting it together), and know everything you're putting on it
- How are you gonna process this data, complications, how to interpret, etc...
- What is the central DOGMA


The PI has an opporunity to make a statement, what the strengths are, weaknesses, etc.
