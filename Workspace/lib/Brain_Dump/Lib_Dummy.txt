Sprint
- Talk to David about getting the Mototrack file structure
- Talk to Jonathan about breakout and connecting stimulation port directly feeded into the headcap
- Read Project Narrative In-depthly

Intan Project Tasks:
- Python Code to read in RHD Files. 
- Python Code to stream file LIVE
- Talk to Jonathon about getting admin rights to Volunteer Computer

Want to H5 file format
Map out file nested structure for a given rat on a given session with universal/standardized naming convention
Example of how an h5 file might be structured:
- File: "WeatherData.h5"  
    - Group: "Temperature" 
        - Dataset: "CityA_Daily_Max" 


Requirements for Intan RHX Interface 
- Contact David for example of mototrack file
    - Similar to file structure we wanna use for this
        - Session > Trial > Raw Data > Time 
- Focus on File Structure 



Volunteers Project Idea
- Live Streaming Data from TCP to Generate Plot in PySide6 GUI
- Python Codes to read in RHD files, visualize data, and save/store data
- Front-End GUI Development to incorporate targetted features
- Down The Line: Integrate Current Intan Set-up with Openephys System






Backlog
- Read Dr. Meyers' Dissertations: {https://www.proquest.com/pqdtlocal1006281/docview/2087776469/E4E1D789F8AE458EPQ/1?accountid=7120&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses}
- Read Neuroscience CH. 1-8, then Ch. 16-17
- Read VNS Papers from Dr. Hays and Dr. Kilgard
- Go through Python Stuff

Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)


What are faculty looking
- Single Slide and the importance (spend a lot of time putting it together), and know everything you're putting on it
- How are you gonna process this data, complications, how to interpret, etc...
- What is the central DOGMA


The PI has an opporunity to make a statement, what the strengths are, weaknesses, etc.
