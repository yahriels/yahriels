Questions
--------------
- How VNS works (circuitry) -> VNS has ascending tract
    - NTS - LC has projections to Spinal Cord 
        - Tract of VNS
        - Tract of HROC

- First Line Therapy Treatements

- VNS directs plasticity, and there is now way of targeting spasticity (which is why we need HROC)

- Current rehab interventions in Spasticity 
    - FES -> functional electrical stimulation

- Think about what is actually happening physiologically, and how does HROC work? 
- Descending control from ...

- Why? 

- Block descending control in SCI
- Block descending control in innervation of LC 

- Spinal cord injury? Why? What is the nature of the injury? 

- Analysis done?

Question Prompts:


I am doing a presentation and am presenting my "Yahriel Salinas-Reyes Quad Chart" which is based on the "Project Narrative_VeROC" where spasticity is the main problem we are tackling as described in "spasticity.pdf". Now give me an overview of the main principles and topics I need to know, which in-depth descriptions, from "Neuro_Textbook_CH8,16-17.pdf" and how it relates to the rest of the project or presentation. And then give me some talking points I must hit in my presentation. 


I am having trouble understanding what the criterion for classifying a 'successful trial' and delivering a food reward to rats from Trial to Trial, and within trial of H-Reflex Operant Conditioning.
