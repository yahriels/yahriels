We implant on the left cervical Vagus Nerve? Why? Why not do it in the right nerve? 

~ Excerpt
"Female Sprague–Dawley rats (250–350 g) were implanted with a platinum–iridium bipolar  cuff electrode around the leftcervicalvagus nerve9. As in humans, only the left vagus nerve was stimulated because the right vagus nerve contains efferents that stimulate the sinoatrial node and can cause cardiac complications"

Complications with implants, and potential problems 

Nature of the lesion

------------
Injury is a collection of circuits that gets changed as compensatory 

Compensatory Mechanisms
- Compensatory Plasticity 
- Reactive Plasticity

ADDRESS THIS AS A CIRCUIT problem
CUZ IT IS A CIRCUIT problem
WE WANT TO TARGET THE MALADAPTIVE PROBLEMS IN THE CIRCUIT


supraspinal 

How is it currently treated? 
1. Botox Injection
2. Baclofen 
Side Effects


Focus on the circuit network, these circuits change due to Injury
The changes can be maladaptive vs beneficial.
- So we can we leverage these changes with plasticity in the changes to improve function
- Can we drive changes in the circuit network to improve function which we call beneficial plasticity

- Short description for upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron

- Injury causes maladaptive changes, why is conditioning of the H-Reflex the answer.
    - Hyperreflexia, so we want to reduce the reflex of response which is then a main component contributing to spasticity
        - Sensory feedback going back to the spinal cord, and the reflex is much more hyper excitable 

Think about AIMs, what are the measures of success. 
    - Hypothesis, Outcome Measure, Statistics
    - 

M-wave and H-Wave

Peripheral Nerve (Mixed)
- Has got motor fibers (neurons) and sensory fibers (neurons)
    - motor fibers gets activated first
    - sensory fibers then feedback 

- If nerve is really long (conduction velocity)
    - Nerve Lengths (Shorter Path)
    - With Soleus the Nerves are much longer which is why we 
    - Has more to do with Anatomy


Protocol (40 day)
Trial (1 stim and 1 reward)


Why do we expect to VNS to be better than food reward

- Can't really do it in people, cuz we can't really food deprive people

- Food reward is motivation
    - works similar to neuromodulatory as VNS
    - Need to be hungry, in order to actually activate neuromodulatory 
    - INtrinsic motivation system that affects the motivation 
    - Based on internal state of ANIMAL

- Look into reward systems and reinforcement learning systems 

- VNS can hijack the reward mechanism by directly stimulating 
    - Less intrinsic and not reliant on the state of subject 

Reward and reinforcement systems, driven by the neuromodulatory feedback reward systems 

------------
>>> Present the opposite
We expect VNS and VNS + Food to be equivalent 
- We speculate is that we are saturating the reward system
    - Clinical utility, like having people do it at home while watching TV etc. 
- VNS is already activating these 

CLINICAL UTILITY IS YOUR REWARD AND IS YOUR stimulation
    - People can actively do something, and while not attending to the therapy itself
    - So people can sit on their couch with this thing attached to their leg, having it send stimulation while their watching TV, and still get the benefits while not paying attention at all.

Question Prompts:


I am doing a presentation and am presenting my "Yahriel Salinas-Reyes Quad Chart" which is based on the "Project Narrative_VeROC" where spasticity is the main problem we are tackling as described in "spasticity.pdf". Now give me an overview of the main principles and topics I need to know, which in-depth descriptions, from "Neuro_Textbook_CH8,16-17.pdf" and how it relates to the rest of the project or presentation. And then give me some talking points I must hit in my presentation. 


I am having trouble understanding what the criterion for classifying a 'successful trial' and delivering a food reward to rats from Trial to Trial, and within trial of H-Reflex Operant Conditioning.

QE is Spring 2025
8:30 AM - 2:00 PM
Present in conference room of your research
- expected to know your area of research
- know what people have done
- know the background of your work
- know the what is going on in your area of research

Quad shot  (Keep words to a minimum and use concept diagrams)
1. Description:
- Please describe the broad of your research (Your why and your area of research, what is the significance)
2. Concept Diagram:
- Draw a schematic concept diagram summarizing key features of your research
3. Objectives:
- Initial understanding of the objectives of your research (What are objectives/aims of the research, personal contributions )
4. Scope of Research:
- State the areas of implementation of your research (What is my research going to cover, what I will have explained through my PhD, expected outcomes)
