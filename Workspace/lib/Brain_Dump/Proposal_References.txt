Dr. Meyers Notes:{Here is the paper I was referring to earlier. My notes from my discussion with Dr. Martin during his visit last November are below:

Spasticity in animal models is typically measured through Hyperreflexia
Model that produces the most consistent Hyperreflexia is the unilateral pyramidal tract lesion (they’ve also seen it with bilateral lesions)
They’ve done approx. 30 animals recently and all have produced Hyperreflexia, measured by loss of rate dependent depression in h-reflex
They’ve measured H-reflex in both the ADQ (abductor digit minima muscle) and also ECR (extensor carpi radials)
They see RDD changes starting 2 days after pyramidal lesions, and as far out as 12 weeks (that’s the furthest they measured); it does not recover over time
Their idea is that reduced descending activity causes spinal sprouting (1a afferents form more connections with motoneurons) that leads to Hyperreflexia 
Ladder run is standard behavioral outcome they see functional impairments with
He mentioned multiple times he is willing to train us on the procedures if we are interested (pyramidal lesions, h-reflex, RDD, etc.); his grad student (Thelma) is graduating, and he would really like to see this work continue
They have a paper coming out soon (link above), and a few more coming behind that. The others haven’t been published yet, they are still writing.}
