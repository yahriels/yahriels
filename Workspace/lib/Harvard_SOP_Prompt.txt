Statement of Purpose Draft for Yahriel Salinas-Reyes
Nature’s Chaos Game: An Existentialist Approach Informed by Mathematics and Neurobiology
Introduction: Mental health disorders represent a profound challenge to contemporary society, impacting millions of lives worldwide. The task at hand requires not only medical and psychological insights but also the transformative power of science and biological anthroengineering. This proposed research operates at the crossroads of diverse scientific disciplines, with two primary objectives: first, to decode the intricate neurobiological landscape of schizophrenia, and second, to uncover the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of potential natural antidepressants found in grapes. Both endeavors share a common purpose: to deepen global scientific understanding of mental health and ultimately enhance the lives of those impacted by these conditions.
Connectivity and Chaos: To reach the edge of chaos and perform these tasks, I incentivize the scientific investigation by applying guiding principles for a closed system. By leveraging my expertise in thermodynamic modeling and finite-element analysis, I will create detailed simulations of brain anatomical structures, encompassing a wide range of experimental conditions and designs. Let 𝛴 be a smooth oriented surface that is bounded, 𝜕𝛴 ≡ 𝛤; then, we invoke boundary conditions. Furthermore, entropy, represented by 𝑆, is a measure of morphology or order in the system, 𝜕𝑆 ≡ 𝑁; I validate this mathematical theorem with the second set of equations. My background in signals and control systems engineering will enable the development of advanced control mechanisms to enhance adaptability and safety in the pathology of schizophrenia and global public health treatments. Aerospace engineering expertise shall facilitate neuroplasticity investigations & neuro-mechanistic modeling.
Governing Equations: [1] Energy: 𝛷𝐸 = ∯ 𝐸 ⋅ ⅆ𝐴, [2] Mobility: ∬ (𝛻 × 𝐹) ⋅ ⅆ𝛴 𝛴 = ∮ 𝐹 ⋅ ⅆ𝛤 𝜕𝛴 , and [3] Continuity: ∭ (𝛻 ⋅ 𝐹) ⅆ𝑉 𝑉 = ∯ (𝐹 ⋅ 𝑛̂) ⋅ ⅆ𝑆 𝑆.
Chaos Theory: [4] Chaos-Game: 𝑥𝑛+1 = 𝜆𝑥𝑛 (1 − 𝑥𝑛 ), [5] Mandelbrot-Set: 𝑍𝑛+1 = 𝑍𝑛 2 + 𝐶, and [6] Fractals: 𝐷 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑁 / 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑆.
Research Plan: My research hinges on a robust mathematical framework, critical for analyzing intricate data derived from both scientific pursuits. The application of Monte Carlo Integration, Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometry of Nature, and artificial intelligence techniques empowers us to model and analyze the intricate data from these two distinct yet interconnected research streams. The research plan will unfold over five years:
1.	Year 1: Data collection and establishment of the research framework.
2.	Year 2: Neuroimaging and genetic data analysis.
3.	Year 3: Development of mathematical models.
4.	Year 4: Validation of models and refinement of findings.
5.	Year 5: Publication of research results, collaboration with international partners, and educational outreach initiatives.
Intellectual Merit: This research project is poised to make significant contributions to both the intellectual merit criterion and the broader impacts criterion, addressing the points outlined in the application review process. Here's how it aligns with the five key components:
1. Potential to Advance Knowledge: Our multidisciplinary approach, combining precision biology, cutting-edge technology, and mathematical frameworks, brings innovation to the study of mental health. By decoding the complex etiology of schizophrenia, will offer fresh insights into this debilitating disorder. Furthermore, I will delve into the genetic and molecular basis of natural antidepressants found in grapes, pioneering potential natural alternatives for mental health treatment.
2. Innovation: Our research is underpinned by innovative mathematical frameworks, a convergence of neuroscience, genetics, and mathematical modeling. This synthesis of diverse disciplines fosters innovation, promising novel findings that can revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia and potentially provide safer alternatives for individuals affected by mental health disorders.
3. Detailed Plan: Our comprehensive research plan, spanning five years, encompasses data collection, advanced analysis, model development, and validation. The plan is characterized by its systematic and strategic approach, with built-in measures of success to ensure the attainment of meaningful results.
4. Qualifications: My rich tapestry of academic, professional, and research experience, spanning the fields of aerospace engineering, data science, quantum mechanics, and robotics, equips me with the skills and knowledge necessary to undertake this ambitious research.
5. Ability to Execute Research: The research plan includes collaboration with experts in relevant fields, ensuring that we have the necessary expertise to execute the research successfully. Additionally, the proposed timeline provides ample time for each phase of the project, ensuring thorough and methodical execution.
Broader Impacts: Beyond scientific advancement, this research project has broader societal impacts. It has the potential to:
1. Advance Mental Health Care: By deepening our understanding of schizophrenia and identifying potential natural antidepressants, this research can pave the way for more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.
2. Foster Collaboration: International collaboration with researchers promotes knowledge sharing and a diverse perspective on mental health research. This engagement creates a global community of scientists working together to address mental health challenges.
3. Educational Outreach: The project's outreach initiatives will inspire future scientists and promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields. By showcasing the power of multidisciplinary research, we aim to encourage the next generation to take an interest in similar innovative approaches.
4. Precision Medicine: By identifying the genetic and neural factors contributing to schizophrenia, this research can contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches tailored to individual patients, enhancing the effectiveness of treatment.
5. Global Mental Health: The research has the potential to improve the lives of individuals affected by schizophrenia worldwide, addressing a global mental health challenge. Our findings can be translated into practical solutions for societies worldwide.
Conclusion: The proposed research, an ambitious undertaking at the intersection of mathematics, biology, and mental health, holds great promise for enhancing our understanding of schizophrenia and the potential natural antidepressants found in grapes. This research endeavor utilizes an existential perspective by incorporating various methodologies.
•	Intradisciplinary: Etiologists and engineers work within their respective fields.
•	Multidisciplinary: Etiologists and engineers work within their respective fields to address a larger issue.
•	Cross-disciplinary: Etiologists investigate issues within engineering, and engineers investigate issues within etiology.
•	Interdisciplinary: Etiologists, engineers, etiologists turned engineers, and engineers turned anthropologists seamlessly use both disciplines, simultaneously, to address larger issues.
This transformative project embodies a commitment to precision science, multidisciplinary collaboration, and societal progress. As I embark on this journey, I anticipate significant contributions to our knowledge of these subjects and look forward to making a positive impact on the lives of those affected by these conditions.
