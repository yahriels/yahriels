Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Intellectual Framework and Phases of Approach: 
SCIENTIFIC STORYTELLING NARRATIVE:
{
Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Scientific Stortelling Narrative: 
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.
Phase I: Understanding The Divided Self and Existential Despair
Header: A Trip Through Insanity - a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.
Motivation: Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair. Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreaminess easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 
Stage 1: Alogia – Poverty of Speech and Senses
Stage 2: Autism –Realism and Logicism
State 3: Ambivalence – State of Chaos and Hysteria
State 4: Affect Blunting – Emotionless and Expressionless
Outcome: Pandemonium and Complete Fracturing of The Self and Nature
Accessories: Mania and Madness, Paranoia and Delusions, Psychosis and Schizophrenia 
Revelation: We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love. Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.
Phase II: Unraveling The Nature of Intelligence and Human Ingenuity
Header: Creative people who can't help but explore other mental territories are at greater risk, just as someone who climbs a mountain is more at risk than someone who just walks along a village lane. 
Motivation: Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death.
Stage 1: Youthfulness – Vitality and Radiance
Stage 2: Imagination – Idealism and Irrationalism
Stage 3: Curiosity – State of Wonder and Exploration
Stage 4: Dreaminess – Absorption, Abstraction, Distraction, and Forgetfulness
Outcome: Dawn of New Age and Realization of The Natural Self and Frontiers
Accessories: Peace and Tranquility, Freedom and Healing, Joy and Growth
Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.
}
Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field of study captures the essence of Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and psychosis and the idea that chaos theory and theory of confusion may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The project title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language as well as Anthropology-Engineering methods, the proposed scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.

Phase 1: The Divided Self and Existential Despair: Unraveling the Nature of Intelligence

In the first phase of my intellectual framework, I delve into the understanding of the divided self and existential despair. Inspired by the words of R.D. Laing, who proposed that schizophrenia arises from the battle between imposed identity and authentic self, I explore the stages of alogia, autism, ambivalence, and affect blunting. These stages represent a journey through poverty of speech and senses, realism and logicism, chaos and hysteria, to the point of emotional numbness and complete fracturing of the self.

As a researcher, my aim is not just to study schizophrenia as a medical condition but to interpret it as a reaction to the divided self – a sane response to an insane world. This perspective aligns with the National Geographics program's commitment to exploring the complex interplay between science, technology, and society. This Program stands out as the ideal environment for my research due to its emphasis on interdisciplinary studies and its recognition of the socio-cultural dimensions of scientific and technological advancements.

Phase 2: Unraveling The Nature of Intelligence and Human Ingenuity

In the second phase of my framework, I transition to unraveling the nature of intelligence and human ingenuity. Drawing inspiration from the idea that creative individuals exploring other mental territories are at greater risk, I explore youthfulness, imagination, curiosity, and dreaminess as stages leading to the dawn of a new age and the realization of the natural self.

This phase aligns with National Geographics ethos of pushing boundaries and fostering innovation. Emphasis on exploring the cultural, historical, and ethical dimensions of science and technology resonates with my approach of integrating neuroscience with anthropology and engineering. MIT's rich tradition of pioneering research and its commitment to fostering creativity make it the perfect platform for me to advance my understanding of human ingenuity and its intersections with mental health.
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.

At its core, the project is driven by the ambition to conduct a comprehensive molecular analysis of grapes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of antioxidants. Grapes have garnered scientific interest due to their potential health benefits and their recent recognition as potential natural antidepressants. Yahriel's unique background in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) equips him with the precision and expertise required to delve into the microscopic realm of chromosomes and molecules—an essential prerequisite for unveiling the genetic secrets grapes hold. To fulfill the project's objectives, advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology systems engineering will be employed. The primary goal is to pinpoint the specific compounds within grapes responsible for their potential antidepressant properties, involving their isolation and characterization to illuminate their mechanisms of action within the brain. The aim is to identify practical applications for mental health treatment by comprehending the genetic and molecular foundation of natural antidepressant production in grapes. 
Concurrently, this research adopts a multifaceted approach to unravel the complexities of schizophrenia, a debilitating and chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits. At the heart of schizophrenia's enduring enigma are Bleuler's four A's: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect blunting. Extensive research has explored the etiology of schizophrenia, leading to the emergence of three prominent theories: genetic, neurodevelopmental, and neurobiological. Each theory offers a distinct perspective on the origins of this complex disorder, making it challenging to pinpoint a single causative factor. Nonetheless, neurobiological theory has gained prominence due to its comprehensive approach, explaining schizophrenia as a result of abnormal brain dysfunctions or structural anomalies. This theory stands on solid scientific ground, holds promise in guiding treatment strategies, transcends cultural and demographic boundaries, and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to alternative theories. Structural and functional abnormalities in key brain systems (i.e., the prefrontal & medial temporal lobes) play a pivotal role in the manifestation of schizophrenia symptoms that are integral to working memory and declarative memory processes. The disrupted functioning contributes to cognitive impairments and emotional dysregulation in individuals with schizophrenia. In the quest to understand schizophrenia, neuroplasticity—the brain's remarkable capacity to adapt and reorganize itself in 
response to learning, experiences, and environmental changes—emerges as a crucial factor operating at various levels, from synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections between neurons is modified, to large-scale changes in brain structure and function. In the context of schizophrenia, neuroplasticity offers hope for improving cognitive functioning and overall quality of life for affected individuals. Research has shown that cognitive remediation therapies— which harness neuroplasticity—can lead to improvements in cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, mitigating some of the cognitive impairments associated with the disorder.
