The Problem: Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects a small percentage of the population. Professionals in the field of schizophrenia research that will be on our team include psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and geneticists. These professionals work together to study the underlying causes of schizophrenia, including genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors. While there is still much to learn about the etiology of schizophrenia, recent research has provided some insights into the factors that may contribute to its development.

Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Intellectual Framework and Phases of Approach: 
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.
Phase I: Understanding The Divided Self and Existential Despair
Header: A Trip Through Insanity - a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.
Motivation: Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair. Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreaminess easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 
Stage 1: Alogia – Poverty of Speech and Senses
Stage 2: Autism –Realism and Logicism
State 3: Ambivalence – State of Chaos and Hysteria
State 4: Affect Blunting – Emotionless and Expressionless
Outcome: Pandemonium and Complete Fracturing of The Self and Nature
Accessories: Mania and Madness, Paranoia and Delusions, Psychosis and Schizophrenia 
Revelation: We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love. Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.
Phase II: Unraveling The Nature of Intelligence and Human Ingenuity
Header: Creative people who can't help but explore other mental territories are at greater risk, just as someone who climbs a mountain is more at risk than someone who just walks along a village lane. 
Motivation: Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death.
Stage 1: Youthfulness – Vitality and Radiance
Stage 2: Imagination – Idealism and Irrationalism
Stage 3: Curiosity – State of Wonder and Exploration
Stage 4: Dreaminess – Absorption, Abstraction, Distraction, and Forgetfulness
Outcome: Dawn of New Age and Realization of The Natural Self and Frontiers
Accessories: Peace and Tranquility, Freedom and Healing, Joy and Growth
Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.
that will be on our team include psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and geneticists. These professionals work together to study the underlying causes of schizophrenia, including genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors. While there is still much to learn about the etiology of schizophrenia, recent research has provided some insights into the factors that may contribute to its development.
Partnership with Dr. José González-Valdez Director of Outreach and Research Diplomacy, School of Engineering and Sciences, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey, at Tecnológico de Monterrey, in the Molecular and Systems Bioengineering Research Group and the FEMSA Biotechnology Center. Tecnológico de Monterrey stands ready to provide Yahriel with the resources, mentorship, and collaborative environment he deserves to excel in his chosen path and with the mission of the Fulbright-National Geographic Program and National Geographic Society. Together, we shall forge connections, advance knowledge, and safeguard the wonders of our world.
Statement of Grant Purpose Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. Potential Local Collaborators: Here are some professionals in the etiology of schizophrenia that are local and/or near Des Moines, Iowa:
Dr. David Miklowitz: A professor of psychiatry and neurology at Drake University who specializes in schizophrenia and provides patient care at the Van Andel Research Institute.
Dr. Eamon McCreery: A professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa who studies schizophrenia pathophysiology and provides treatment at the Iowa City campus.
Dr. John Cutilla: A professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Iowa who studies the molecular basis of schizophrenia and
Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field of study captures the essence of Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and psychosis and the idea that chaos theory and theory of confusion may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The project title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language as well as Anthropology-Engineering methods, the proposed scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.
**Project Title:**  "How He Got His Scars: The Nature Physicist Explores Abnormal Human Ingenuity and the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Neurobiological Representations of Schizophrenia and Psychosis."
**Summary:**
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness and chaos, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of insanity and confusion as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease or psychotic behaviors (i.e. a common sympton of schizophrenic traits), schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. Comprehensively, the label of **Madness and Confusion is defined as a naturally sane reaction to an insane world**. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia/psychosis and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.
Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.
The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.
To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.
In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness and confusion, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.
