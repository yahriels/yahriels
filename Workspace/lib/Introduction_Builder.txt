SPECIAL TOPIC: Phase-change Materials and Their Applications
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SPECIAL TOPIC
A better understanding of phase-change materials facilitates optimal design, and their strategic integration in devices/systems helps reach new theoretical limits that are intrinsic to more traditional materials. This broad field encompasses multiple phenomena and different operational principles, which have been cleverly used for demonstrating technological advantages. However, the underlying physics of some phase-change materials is yet to be fully understood, casting a shadow on the full potential of devices/systems relying on phase-change materials. This special topic welcomes contributions that demonstrate the integration of phase-change materials into sensors and actuators that exploit their multifunctionality, and fundamental studies that help understand them

Topics covered include, but are not limited to:

Theory, modeling and simulation of solid-to-solid phase transitions
Implementation of phase-change materials in memory devices and systems
Advances in thermal energy and storage
Integration of phase-change materials in energy efficient buildings and smart textiles

\section{Introduction:}
 Interest in synthetic composite materials has garnered signifi
cant attention largely due to their high specific properties,
 tunable functionalities, and potential to incorporate advanced
 responsive behaviors.1 Recent advances have largely focused on
 stimuli-responsive composites, which exhibit tunable properties
 when subjected to a specified trigger. Such materials have
 been applied as sensors, actuators, and platforms for multi
functional devices. Mechanically reconfigurable parts are
 especially critical in soft robotics and analogous functional
 devices, whereby adaptive components are essential for con
trolled locomotion, actuation, stiffness tuning, and as deployable
 components. In particular, initially soft materials that can
 dramatically increase in rigidity and be programmed into desired
 shapes can be utilized in fields ranging from soft and bio
inspired robotics to reconfigurable and wearable electronics.
 Several forms of activation have been applied in responsive
 composites, and common examples include temperature,21–24
 electromagnetic radiation,25 as well as electric and magnetic
 fields. Recent developments in smart responsive composites have utilized
 various stimuli including heat, light, solvents, electricity, and
 magnetic fields to induce a change in material properties. Here, we
 report a thermodynamically driven mechanically responsive compo
site, exploiting irreversible phase-transformation (relaxation) of meta
stable undercooledliquid metal core shell particle fillers. Thermal and
 mechanical analysis reveals that as the composite is deformed, the
 particles transform from individual liquid droplets to a solid metal
 network, resulting in a 300 percent increase in Young’s modulus. Incontrast
 to previous phase change materials, this dramatic change in stiffness
 occurs autonomously under deformation, is insensitive to environ
mentalconditions,and doesnotrequire externalenergy sources such
 as heat, light, or electricity. We demonstrate the utility of this
 approach by transforming a flat, flexible biocomposite strip of cellulose paper, into a highly efficient and disposable piezoresistor that is highly sensitive, also referred to as Quantum Tunnelling Composites (QTC's).
 In contemporary technology, the integration of phase-change materials (PCMs) into piezoresistive Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)sensors holds promise for significantly enhancing their performance and functionality. This paper delves into the theoretical foundations and practical applications of PCM-enhanced MEMS sensors, focusing particularly on optimizing sensor design and fabrication processes. For the duration of this study, the focus was in synthesizing biocomposites with cellulose-based paper with heat-free fabrication processes. By conducting a thorough review of the literature on PCMs, MEMS sensors, and solid-to-solid phase transitions, this research aims to shed light on the transformative potential of PCMs in sensor technology. The utilization of PCMs offers the prospect of tunable mechanical properties, heightened sensitivity, and reduced power consumption, thereby revolutionizing sensor applications across various domains such as healthcare, aerospace, and structural monitoring. Dr. Thuo's Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers relies on frustration of liquid solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. This study not only contributes to academic knowledge but also holds implications for real-world technological advancements.
 Metals and organics possess two very dissimilar surface energies, hence, 
do not naturally adhere to each other. This incompatibility is exacerbated by 
surface roughness yet advances in wearables and bioelectronics call for their 
integration. Mesoscale mechanical bonds, however, transcend the necessi
ties of surface energy matching while taking advantage of surface texture. 
 By exploiting the benefits of these undercooled core-shell 
particles in association with piezoresistive micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), the 
presented design creates an elegant high efficiency, frugal sensor technology. In 
comparison to intricate electronics designs, piezoresistive MEMS devices simply create 
connections between mechanical stimuli and resistivity via the piezoresistive effect.1 Note 
that the main argument of this paper lies in exploiting the differences between paper
based MEMS utilizing silver paste (Standard), 
and emphasizing the benefits of introducing 
this research group’s FM particles into a new 
MEMS Design.
