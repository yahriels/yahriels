> Enter text here : Personal Statement - Intellectual Merit:
In the vast tapestry of human existence, I, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, find myself intricately woven into a unique pattern, a testament to resilience, curiosity, and an unyielding pursuit of knowledge. I wear multiple hats—storyteller, poet, musician, engineer, and scientist. My life's narrative not only speaks to overcoming challenges but underscores the power of embracing neurodiversity, fostering inclusivity, and redefining obstacles as strengths.
Originating in the tranquil town of Iowa, where hidden treasures abound, my journey intersected with Don—an enigmatic individual, born without the ability to hear, much like myself in my earlier, deaf years. His eyes, full of wonder, served as a gateway to understanding reality. During a period of "existential fracturing," I sought solace in Don's wisdom, delving into the "music of silence." His mentorship reshaped my perspective, teaching me to find beauty and wisdom in life's quiet moments. Don's influence steered me towards a less-trodden path, one where I would seek knowledge beyond conventional boundaries. As my name, Yahriel, implies, I am free—free to explore the boundless realms of aerospace engineering.
Iowa State University and a later voyage to Caltech & Stanford marked the beginning of my intellectual odyssey, providing the intellectual tools to decode the mathematical language underlying the cosmos. Yet, it was the discovery of fractal mathematics that truly ignited my passion. Fractals, intricate patterns transcending the ordinary, became my canvas for curiosity, representing the junction between chaos and order—akin to my mind shaped by neurological diversity, in constant transformation from chaos to beauty.
Navigating into the realm of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), I honed my skills in precision design and innovation. However, it was the interplay between order and chaos, exemplified by fractals, that captivated me. This fascination fueled a quest to understand, translate, and reveal the inherent beauty in mathematical patterns. In the academic arena, mentors played instrumental roles, guiding me through the labyrinth of academia and instilling the value of passing knowledge forward.
While my journey held moments of revelation and transformation, it also led me into the depths of darkness. Lost in chaos, my mother's unwavering support became my strength. Her question during challenging times, "What do you see in this darkness, my dear?" prompted my response, "I see what I want to see." This skill of transforming darkness into fresh starts became an asset in my academic pursuits.
An interdisciplinary approach unfolded as I integrated Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a passion for mental health. This intersection marked a unique avenue that I intended to explore further. In this journey, the power of mentorship and advocacy became evident. I recognized academia should be inclusive, celebrating diversity and empowering every individual to reach their full potential. My commitment extends beyond scholarship—I aspire to be a mentor and advocate for neurodiverse individuals, inspiring them to recognize their potential in the scientific community.
Personal Statement - Broader Impacts:
My unwavering dedication to neuroscience, particularly in the context of neurodiversity and mental health, propels my future goals. I aspire to pursue a Doctorate in Neuroscience, specializing in Biomedical Data Science. In this interdisciplinary domain, I aim to delve into neural data, extracting patterns from the chaotic symphony of neurons. By combining mathematics and neuroscience, I hope to contribute to novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for mental health disorders.
The GEM Consortium Fellowship is a significant milestone I aspire to achieve, enhancing my educational pursuits and validating my commitment to the intersection of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity. This esteemed award aligns seamlessly with my goals and values, emphasizing innovation and broader impacts.
Post-doctorate, I envision working in academic research, bridging the gap between mathematics and mental health. My career goals extend to mentoring and advocating for neurodiverse individuals, envisioning a future where inclusivity in academia is a reality. As I traverse the intersecting realms of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity, my journey mirrors a musical metaphor—an intricate blend of chaos and beauty, weaving discordant notes into a harmonious symphony.
Relevant Background:
My academic journey began at the renown ISU of Science and Technology, home of The Cyclones and Original Designers of the Computer, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. The rigorous standards equipped me with essential skills for graduate school and beyond, exposing me to the mathematical intricacies underlying the cosmos.
A pivotal moment occurred with the discovery of fractal mathematics, leading to projects involving fractal-based simulations. This exemplified my commitment to extending mathematical boundaries and uncovering hidden beauty. Embracing an interdisciplinary approach, I bridged the gap between mathematics and mental health research, navigating challenges and contributing meaningfully to the scientific community.
My academic background reflects dedication to aerospace engineering and a passionate pursuit of mathematics, laying the foundation for excellence, innovation, and broader impacts on the world of science.
