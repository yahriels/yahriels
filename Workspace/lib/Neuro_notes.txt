Closed-Loop Stimulation
Closed-loop neurostimulation is a form of neuromodulation that provides therapeutic stimulation only when necessary. It has been explored for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. (1, 2) An early application of closed loop neurostimulation is in the treatment of refractory epilepsy – when seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medication alone. Much like a pacemaker stops abnormal heart rhythms, a closed-loop device aims to halt epileptic seizures by delivering stimulation when it detects the beginnings of seizure activity. A programmable responsive neurostimulation (RNS) brain implant for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy received approval from the FDA in November 2013. (3) Since then, studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes, with 53% median seizure reduction after two years and 70% median seizure reduction after five years. (4)

Hello Dr. Thuo,

I hope you are doing well. At the beginning of this summer, I received a notification that I had been accepted into the GEM PhD in Science and Engineering Fellowship with the National GEM Consortium and a component of this program was to complete a summer internship. This summer I have worked as an intern with Bayer R&D (Crop Science) in Regulatory Science & Affairs within the Toxicology Team, where I provided automation and data engineering solutions. 

While I was accepted into the fellowship, I was not accepted into a PhD program at the time. However, this past week I presented to the leadership team of the GEM Consortium (The CEO and Director). Something amazing happened this week and Director Dr. Marcus Huggans worked with me and was able to put forward a special favor to the President of UT Dallas (who is a GEM Alumni) to consider my application for a PhD program at UT Dallas to start this Fall 2024! 

With a very quick turnaround, I am now able to put in a Rush Application in consideration for admission this Fall 2024 with the help of your recommendation. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping me get admitted to this Biomedical Engineering PhD program.
 
Let me know if you require any information or assistance from me. 

Your support and guidance in pursuing admission to a PhD program for Fall 2024 hold the potential to significantly shape my future. I am sincerely grateful for your investment in my academic and professional journey!



Yahriel's current internship with Bayer Crop Science in the Seeds and Traits Safety Division of the R&D Regulatory Science Toxicology Team has further prepared him for his doctoral studies in biomedical engineering. At Bayer, Yahriel has been involved in developing digital and software solutions for regulatory affairs, working with cross-functional teams to ensure the safety and efficacy of new agricultural products. This role has provided him with invaluable industry experience and a deeper understanding of the real-world applications of biomedical research. His work at Bayer has also equipped him with the skills necessary to navigate complex regulatory environments and collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders, which are crucial for success in his PhD program.



Dear Dr. Ward, I hope you are doing well. This summer I was confirmed as a GEM PhD Science and Engineering Fellow while not admitted to a PhD program yet. Director Dr. Marcus Huggans (GEM Leadership) worked with me this past week and was able to put forward a special favor to the President of UT Dallas (who is a GEM Alumni) to consider my application for a PhD program at UT Dallas to start this Fall 2024! With a very quick turnaround, I am now able to put in a Rush Application in consideration for admission this Fall 2024 with the help of your recommendation.
