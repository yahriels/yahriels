Closed-Loop Stimulation
Closed-loop neurostimulation is a form of neuromodulation that provides therapeutic stimulation only when necessary. It has been explored for conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. (1, 2) An early application of closed loop neurostimulation is in the treatment of refractory epilepsy – when seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medication alone. Much like a pacemaker stops abnormal heart rhythms, a closed-loop device aims to halt epileptic seizures by delivering stimulation when it detects the beginnings of seizure activity. A programmable responsive neurostimulation (RNS) brain implant for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy received approval from the FDA in November 2013. (3) Since then, studies have demonstrated favorable outcomes, with 53% median seizure reduction after two years and 70% median seizure reduction after five years. (4)
