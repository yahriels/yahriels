Personal Statement
Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Fulbright-National Geographic Stortelling Fellowship Open Study/Research Award
Molecular & Systems Bioengineering towards Neuroscience
In the realm of mathematics, the concept of chaos game originally alluded to a method of 
generating fractals—intricate geometrical patterns that seem to symbolize the fractured nature of 
reality itself. The intricate dance of numbers, shapes, and chaos mirrors my own journey through 
life, marked by a tapestry of neurological and neurodevelopmental challenges.
My story is one of resilience, determination, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and has 
been anything but conventional. From an early age, I grappled with ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, and 
autism. These neurological conditions, instead of being impediments, have become the driving 
force behind my academic pursuits. I realized that within the chaos of my mind, there was an 
unexplored realm of creativity and analytical thinking. However, life had more challenges in 
store. Hearing loss and a speech impediment made communication a daily struggle. But rather 
than let these barriers silence me, I embraced the power of written expression. Writing became 
my voice, a medium through which I could convey my ideas, emotions, and discoveries. As I 
embarked on my academic journey, I encountered a myriad of obstacles that tested my resolve. 
Financial challenges loomed large, threatening to derail my dreams of higher education. Yet, I 
persevered, seeking scholarships and part-time work to support my studies. I also navigated the 
language barrier, as English is not my first language, and adapted to the demands of college life 
in a new world. Physical health issues further complicated matters. Sciatica, a debilitating 
condition, left me bedridden and unable to attend classes. Still, I did not relent. I leveraged 
technology to engage with coursework remotely, demonstrating my unwavering commitment to 
my education. In the midst of these personal challenges, I took on the role of the primary 
caretaker for my mother, who battled severe health issues. This responsibility, while emotionally 
taxing, underscored the importance of resilience and compassion. It reinforced my belief in the 
power of empathy and understanding, qualities I have carried into my academic pursuits. The 
most recent chapter in my life introduced a new set of challenges—adjusting to mental health 
medications and diagnoses. While the journey to stability has been arduous, it has deepened my 
empathy for those facing similar struggles and ignited my interest in the intersection of 
mathematics and mental health. My experiences have shaped my academic journey and my 
aspirations. I am driven by a passion for fractal mathematics, drawn to the beauty of patterns that 
emerge from chaos. I see parallels between the complexity of fractals and the human mind, and I 
am determined to explore these connections. Through these trials, I discovered a profound truth: 
our stories are woven into the tapestry of science and art. We tell stories to make sense of the 
world, to illuminate the unknown, and to connect with others. In Mexico, I hope to immerse 
myself in the rich mathematical heritage of the country, studying under esteemed mentors who 
can help me unlock new dimensions of fractal mathematics. I envision collaborative research 
projects that bridge the gap between mathematics and neurodiversity, shedding light on the 
intricate patterns of the human mind. My story is one of resilience, determination, and an
unshakable belief in the transformative power of education. Amid the chaos of life's challenges, I 
have emerged as a passionate scholar, ready to contribute to the world of mathematics and 
advocate for the value of neurodiversity. I am eager to embark on this journey, where I 
can explore the marvel of the human spirit, using mathematics as my compass to navigate the 
intricate patterns of our world. Together, we will write a new chapter in the wondrous story of 
human ingenuity, science, and nature itself.
