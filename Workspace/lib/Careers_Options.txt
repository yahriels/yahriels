Yahriel's Cover Letter ideas

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow up on my application below for research position in your lab.
I firstly wanted to express my deep interest for this position as I am very interested in research relating to schizophrenia specifically and in neuroimaging techniques, psychiatric Institutional representations of schizophrenia, and psychological/neurological perspectives. As a matter of fact I am captivated by the mystery of schizophrenia and psychosis for my own personal reasons and would like to pursue a PhD in Computational Neuroscience to study this topic. You can check out some of my proposed ideas and interests in Schizophrenia on my personal github page here: https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels  I have also attached some of my related materials to the end of this email.

I am currently a confirmed GEM Fellow of the National GEM Consortium PhD in Science and Engineering Fellowship  and have complete funding for the duration of the PhD (upon acceptance into a PhD program). The GEM Fellowship gives me a year to apply and get into a PhD program, and since I am applying for graduate study in this related topic (Schizophrenia, Neuroscience), this opportunity is a perfect fit for me for this year as I prepare to apply to graduate study in the coming year. 

I am very excited for the prospect of joining this work and would like to learn more about this opportunity if possible. 

Please contact me at your earlier convenience and I look forward to hearing from you!


Also express how you are VERY INTERESTED and passionate about studying  the etiology schizophrenia for your PhD in Computational Neuroscience (exploring psychiatric, neurobiological, and neurological perspectives) for your PhD in Computational Neuroscience, understanding neuropsychiatric disorders, and guiding the scientific and technology community to develop solutions and help global understanding of neuropsychiatric disorder and informing global public health.

I am writing to express my ardent interest in the Research position within the  at Yale. With a background in aerospace engineering and a fervent dedication to scientific inquiry, I am deeply enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your esteemed institution's mission of unraveling the complexities of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia.\\

What draws me most to the Laboratory is its commitment to understanding brain abnormalities and their correlation with psychiatric disorders through state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. The opportunity to contribute to ongoing research studies focused on investigating brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, clinical high risk for psychosis, traumatic brain injury, and other relevant populations resonates deeply with my academic and professional aspirations.\\

Talk About Relevant Research Experience...In my previous roles, including my tenure at Bayer Crop Science and DARPA, I honed my research and data engineering skills, contributing to cutting-edge projects aimed at addressing critical environmental and technological challenges. My experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in scientific inquiry, data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration, which I believe are essential for success in the Research position.\\

Moreover, my passion for exploring the etiology of schizophrenia stems from a profound desire to contribute to the scientific and technological advancements aimed at elucidating the underlying mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders. I am deeply committed to leveraging my interdisciplinary background and technical expertise to guide the scientific and technology community toward developing innovative solutions that inform global understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders and contribute to advancements in global public health.\\

In conclusion, I am eager to bring my unique blend of skills, passion for scientific inquiry, and dedication to the Laboratory. Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your laboratory's groundbreaking research endeavors and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.
