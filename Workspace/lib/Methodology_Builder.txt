SPECIAL TOPIC: Phase-change Materials and Their Applications
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SPECIAL TOPIC
A better understanding of phase-change materials facilitates optimal design, and their strategic integration in devices/systems helps reach new theoretical limits that are intrinsic to more traditional materials. This broad field encompasses multiple phenomena and different operational principles, which have been cleverly used for demonstrating technological advantages. However, the underlying physics of some phase-change materials is yet to be fully understood, casting a shadow on the full potential of devices/systems relying on phase-change materials. This special topic welcomes contributions that demonstrate the integration of phase-change materials into sensors and actuators that exploit their multifunctionality, and fundamental studies that help understand them

Topics covered include, but are not limited to:
- Theory, modeling and simulation of solid-to-solid phase transitions
- Implementation of phase-change materials in memory devices and systems
- Integration of phase-change materials in energy efficient buildings and smart textiles
- Dielectrics, Ferroelectrics, and multiferroics
- Applications and integration of solid-liquid phase transitions
- Thin films, interfaces, and surfaces


Lead the paper into a discussion of the Special Topic:
"This Special Topic welcomes contributions that demonstrate the integration of phase-change materials into sensors and actuators that exploit their multifunctionality, and fundamental studies that help understand them."

\subsection{Device Fabrication}
In fabricating a paper-based 
sensor, a precise, programmable paper cutter 
was used to make various sensor architectures 
(and shapes) and then bonded the 
piezoresistor and FM contact pads to the paper 
substrate via a laser cut stencil (Figure 1a). To 
introduce the mechanism of piezoresistive 
effects, a simple cantilever arm architecture. 
Figure 1B summarizes the process used to fabricate the 
device. We fabricated paper cantilever beams by cutting 
chromatography paper (0.34 mm thick) using a laser cutter.
We manually screen-printed carbon resistors using 
high-resistivity graphite ink, and contact pads using 
low-resistivity sliver ink [7]. We generated a stencil mask by 
cutting designed patterns into vinyl stencil film using a laser 
cutter, placed the stencil mask on top of the patterned paper 
cantilever beams, filled the openings of the stencil mask with 
graphite ink, and removed the stencil mask to form the 
carbon resistor. We baked the paper device at 60 °C for 20 
minutes. After the drying of the graphite ink, we 
screen-printed another layer of silver ink to form the contact 
pads following the same procedure. Fabricating an array of 
paper-based force sensors (Figure 2) typically takes less than 
one hour.
\subsection{Electrical Characterization}
 Noise Measurement System and Signal Conditioning. The experimental set-up
 from the calibration method is modified with a AC biased Vbridge, a bandpass filter, and a
 low-pass filter in series with the sensor interface. The sensor at the interface is sensitive to
 electrical and any observable excitation in the environment (i.e. mechanical)
We measured the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of 
the carbon resistors using a source meter under ambient 
conditions (21°C temperature and 50~60% relative 
humidity). All the measured resistors (N=7) revealed a linear, 
ohmic I-V behavior, and the resistance of the resistors was 
600±190 Ω. We also investigated the temperature 
dependence of the carbon resistors by quantifying the 
temperature coefficient of resistance. We changed the 
environmental temperature for the paper device from 21°C 
(room temperature) to 80°C, and measured the corresponding 
resistance values of the carbon resistor. The temperature 
coefficient of resistance was 0.00067±0.00023/°C (N=7). 
This set of experiments utilized a voltmeter 
(Keithley) connected to a sensor sample (refer to Figure 7). On the free end of the sensor, 
a micro-manager and reference ruler were placed to consistently measure deflection. 
Throughout this set of experiments, the sensor sample was varied where each sample 
had one or two features changed as described in Figure 8. For each experiment, a series 
of five runs (with 10 sweeps) where collected measuring the current as the voltage was 
varied from -0.5V to 0.5 V through the connected sensor sample. Throughout the 5 runs, 
the beam was deflection was varied from 0mm to 20 mm in 5 mm increments. The 
experimental control was the ohmic response (I-V curve data) a reference 100kohm 
resistor. 
\subsection{Damping Mechanisms of Tip-Mass Piezoelectric System}

- [1] https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Manuscript_Stuff/Background%20Lit/%5B1%5DEB_JUN_DRAFT_2022.pdf
Here we characterize the damping response from a commercial piezoelectric transducer when
 it is subjected to free-vibrations. The problem under study is an electromechanical problem and
 hence a combination of dimensionless parameters including the natural frequency of the system,
 are used to study and understand the damping characteristics of the tip-mass-piezoelectric system.
 Rectangular prisms with varying aspect ratios(0.5-3.0) are loaded onto two exible piezoelectric
 transducers rendering the setup to resemble a cantilever tip-mass system.To directly visualize the
 e ect of tip displacement on the voltage generated, high-speed imaging studies of the cantilever are
 performed in addition to separate measurements of the voltage response using an oscilloscope. In
 this paper, we will discuss how these results can further studies into the development of e cient
 energy harvesters.

\subsection{Theorems and Analytical Solutions}
To construct our ideal model, we make a number of assumptions and assume ideal conditions
 in all aspects of the experiment. The sensor therefore is a finite cantilevered beam with
 f
 ixed-free boundary conditions and uniaxial loading (or excitation) on the top surface-place.
 Assuming an ideal thermo-mechanical system, the response to work-energy input on the
 MEMS is recorded as total deformation of the body ε and dimensionless power signal R∗.
 Therefore we define our principal axes in Fig [4] where longitudinal (beam-wise) strain εx
 is measured as well as lateral strain εy. The degree of deformation (i.e. Polarization) at a
 plane/spot is the total body deformation δ ∝ ε and surface slope of θ. Equation [15] is a
 spot deflection approximation where the third term is the dynamic deflection coefficient of
 7
the surface ( Q
 ω3 n 
)1/2 and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at the natural frequency for the
 ladder calculated from ϕ(t)

$\bullet$Stoke's Theorem\\
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface in $R^{3}$ with boundary $\partial\sum\equiv\Gamma$. If a vector field $F(x,y,z) = (F_{x}(x,y,z), F_{y}(x,y,z), F_{z}(x,y,z)$ is defined and has a continuous first order partial derivatives in a region containing $\Sigma$, then
\begin{equation}
    \iint_{\Sigma}(\nabla\times F)\cdot d\Sigma = \oint_{\partial\Sigma}F\cdot d\Gamma 
\end{equation}

$\bullet$Euler-Lagrange Equation\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}}) -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}=0
\end{equation}
The Euler-Lagrange equation is a fundamental equation in the field of analytical mechanics, specifically within the framework of Lagrangian mechanics. It provides a method to derive the equations of motion for a system based on a function called the Lagrangian, $L$, which represents the difference between the kinetic energy ($T$) and potential energy ($V$) of the system, $L = T-V$.

The equation emerges from the principle of stationary action, which states that the path taken by a system between two states, over a certain time, is the one for which the action integral (the integral of the Lagrangian over time) is stationary (usually a minimum). In mathematical terms, for a system described by generalized coordinates $q_i$ and their time derivatives $q'_i$, the Euler-Lagrange equation is expressed as given.

This equation determines how the coordinates $q_i$ evolve over time, effectively describing the dynamics of the system under conservative forces. It is used widely across many fields of physics, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and field theory, to derive the equations governing the motion of systems from molecular to astronomical scales.

> Describe your methodological approach by introducing the way you researched the topic.
> Explain your methods of data collection
> Define each method that you have used for analyzing the topic.
> Select the best and effective method that helped you in gathering the data fast.
> Evaluate and justify your methodological choices.

TIPS FOR WRITING A METHODOLOGY
- Show how and why: Go beyond a simple description of your methods and show how as well as why you used them. This helps demonstrate that you rigorously conducted your research. 
- Draft as you go: Take notes and outline your methodology as you work to make sure you capture all details accurately. The better you record your methods and techniques in real time, the better your methodology will be.
- Focus on you research questions: Relate your methodology choices to the central theme of your research. This shows that you chose the best methods to address the problem raised in your thesis.
- Write for your audience: Craft a methodology that is clearly written and well-structured. Address the audience of your research with good writing, providing more than a list of technical details and procedures.


1. "Help me strike the right balance between providing enough detail to engage readers and avoiding unnecessary jargon in my introduction."
2. "Assist me in constructing an engaging opening hook that captures reader's attention and introduces my research."
3. Guide me in formulating clear aims and objectives for my study by suggesting a list of verbs I can choose from."
4. My literature review feels scrappy and fragmented. Can you give me some specific words and phrases I can use to connect the sections together and integrate the material, so it flows better? They should be fill in the gap sentence starters. Please give me 10.


For improving overall quality of your text:
- Provide a critique of this text from the point of view of someone who doesn't believe the argument made here about [insert your argument]?
- Can you peer-review this text for me in a way that specifically looks out for problems with logical argumentation?
- Propose a better structure for rewriting what I have already written so that the reader can better follow the flow of my arguments?

Paragraph-specific prompts for structure & flow:
- Rewrite this paragraph to enhance its argumentative tone and structure in a way that it leads to highlighting the [insert key message/argument you are trying to get across]?
- I want to reduce the awkwardness of this paragraph. Can you rewrite it in a way that enhances its fluidity without changing the original message? Keep the references. (ESL specific)
- I’m struggling with the transition between these two paragraphs, where I move from discussing [insert aim of paragraph 1] to [insert aim of paragraph 2]. Suggest a smoother transition that enhances the flow?

For assisting you with individual sentences/phrases:
- Can you simplify this sentence without oversimplifying the technical details?
- All my sentences seem to start the same way in this text. Help me rephrase this one to start differently?
- I’m struggling to integrate this quotation [insert quote and author/year] naturally in this broader paragraph. Can you do a seamless integration of this quote into this specific sentence?
- Can you adjust the tone of this sentence to sound more [insert tone]? (Tones commonly used in academic texts: analytical, argumentative, persuasive, questioning, authoritative, explanatory, reflective, speculative, assertive)
