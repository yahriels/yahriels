\section{Methodology}
We are principally probing and developing theory of piezoresistivity and electrical conductivity of polymeric nanocomposites filled with hybrid carbon nanotubes/graphene nanoplatelets, which will be referred to as Carbon Resistor Ink.
The research investigates the impact of incorporating Phase-Change Material (PCM) thin film electrodes in piezoresistive force sensors, comparing them to sensors utilizing conventional low-resistance silver paste electrodes. The effect of this enhancement on sensor fabrication processes, characteristics, and performance is explored.
To address the research objectives, the study employed a comparative approach. Firstly, the fabrication processes of piezoresistive force sensors with PCM thin film electrodes and those with low-resistance silver paste electrodes were thoroughly investigated. This involved examining the materials used, deposition techniques, and sensor assembly procedures.
Furthermore, the characteristics of the sensors were extensively analyzed. This included studying their electrical properties, mechanical stability, and sensitivity to external forces. Special attention was given to the differences arising from the integration of PCM thin film electrodes, such as phase transition behavior and thermal properties.
In terms of performance evaluation, experimental tests were conducted to measure the response of both types of sensors to varying force inputs. This involved utilizing specialized test setups and measurement equipment to capture relevant data. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed to compare the performance metrics of the two sensor configurations.
The results of the study revealed significant differences between the sensors equipped with PCM thin film electrodes and those with conventional silver paste electrodes. Detailed analyses, including tables and consideration of covariates, demonstrated the distinct characteristics and performance profiles of each sensor type.
\section{Materials and Methods}
Using a multi-meter (D.C.), or alternatively, oscilloscope (A.C.) a voltage signal is supplied with a camera recording beam-tip position (Z).
Image and signal processing were carried out to study electrical-mechanical behaviors that are encountered under ambient loads by varying form factors.
The Piezoresistive Strain Gauge is bonded along a fixed-free cantilevered beam that is in-contact with a voltage-measurement system while subjected to mechanical stimuli (Beam-Body Deflection). 
\subsection{Device Fabrication}
In fabricating a paper-based 
sensor, a precise, programmable paper cutter 
was used to make various sensor architectures 
(and shapes) and then bonded the 
piezoresistor and PCM contact pads to the paper 
substrate via a laser cut stencil. In further experiments in the development of a piezoresistive viscous shear sensor, a programmable laser cutter was used to create periodic nano-patterned cuts (kirigami) in the paper substrate. Subsequently the paper-base substrate was immersed in a bath of carbon resistive ink as the sensing element was adhered to the surface of the substrate. 
To introduce the mechanism of piezoresistive 
effects, a simple cantilever arm architecture. 
This is the process used to fabricate the 
device. We fabricated paper cantilever beams by cutting 
chromatography paper (0.34 mm thick) using a laser cutter.
We manually screen-printed carbon resistors using 
high-resistivity graphite ink, and contact pads using 
low-resistivity sliver ink as a control. We generated a stencil mask by 
cutting designed patterns into vinyl stencil film using a laser 
cutter, placed the stencil mask on top of the patterned paper 
cantilever beams, filled the openings of the stencil mask with 
graphite ink, and removed the stencil mask to form the 
carbon resistor. We baked the paper device at 60 °C for 20 
minutes. After the drying of the graphite ink, we 
screen-printed another layer of silver ink to form the contact 
pads following the same procedure. Fabricating an array of 
paper-based force sensors typically takes less than 
one hour.
The subject of this paper and research, is to compare the fabrication processes, characteristics, and performance of the piezoresistive force sensors that use low-resistance silver paste as thin film electrodes to piezoresistive force sensors that are enhanced with Phase-Change Material thin film electrodes. 
\subsection{Calibration of Paper-Based Force Sensor}
We calibrated the paper-based force sensor using a 
precision balance, a LCR meter (for measuring the change in 
resistance), and a multimeter (for measuring the circuit 
output voltage). We acquired the experimental data of 
the change in resistance of the carbon resistor as a function of 
the mechanical strain applied to the carbon resistor. Based on 
this calibration curve, we calculated the gauge factor which is in relation to the electromechanical factor of the 
piezoresistive sensor which is illustrated as a 
calibration curve of the output voltage of the Wheatstone 
bridge circuit as a function of the applied force. 
\subsection{Electrical Characterization}
Piezoresistor (PZR) Sensor Calibration Method. The Wheatstone Bridge is balanced using a single potentiometer where the PZR strain gauge is treated as the variable resistor. The power signal output is amplified using an instrumentation amplifier (INA) and the spectral content of the power or noise signal is measured using a signal analyzer function. The signal is analyzed alternatively by passing the signal through an antialiasing filter, sampled with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and analyzed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. The VBridge input into the wheatstone bridge was subject to DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current) bias throughout the measurements. The electro-mechanical coupling of the measurement system is accomplished through the PZR strain gauge bonded to the top surface of the table-top or cantilever beam. 
Electrical characterization was performed using two Keithley
2400 Source Measuring Units attached to a probe station with a
grounded and movable stage. Film resistivity was determined by measuring the
total voltage drop across the two inner terminal probes and the
applied current on the two outer probes. The thermoelectric
voltage induced by the temperature gradient across the electrodes
was obtained using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. The force
gradient was obtained from the difference in the resistance change, ΔR,
at the film near the two contacts using an IR camera 
We measured the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of 
the carbon resistors using a source meter under ambient 
conditions (21°C temperature and 50~60% relative 
humidity). All the measured resistors revealed a linear, 
ohmic I-V behavior, and the resistance of the resistors was 
600±190 Ω. This was done with a Noise Measurement System and complemented with Signal Conditioning. Here, the experimental set-up
 from the calibration method is modified with a AC biased Vbridge, a bandpass filter, and a
 low-pass filter in series with the sensor interface. The sensor at the interface is sensitive to
 electrical and any observable excitation in the environment (i.e. mechanical)We also investigated the temperature 
dependence of the carbon resistors by quantifying the 
temperature coefficient of resistance. We changed the 
environmental temperature for the paper device from 21°C 
(room temperature) to 80°C, and measured the corresponding 
resistance values of the carbon resistor. The temperature 
coefficient of resistance was 0.00067±0.00023/°C. 
This set of experiments utilized a voltmeter 
(Keithley) connected to a sensor sample (refer to Figure 7). On the free end of the sensor, 
a micro-manager and reference ruler were placed to consistently measure deflection. 
Throughout this set of experiments, the sensor sample was varied where each sample 
had one or two features changed as described in Figure 8. For each experiment, a series 
of five runs (with 10 sweeps) where collected measuring the current as the voltage was 
varied from -0.5V to 0.5 V through the connected sensor sample. Throughout the 5 runs, 
the beam was deflection was varied from 0mm to 20 mm in 5 mm increments. The 
experimental control was the ohmic response (I-V curve data) a reference 100kohm 
resistor. 
\subsection{Damping Mechanisms of Tip-Mass Piezoelectric System}
[1] "EB_JUN_DRAFT_2022" 
- [1] https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Manuscript_Stuff/Background%20Lit/%5B1%5DEB_JUN_DRAFT_2022.pdf
By employing the Lumped model of bending electrostrictive transducers for energy harvesting, previous experimentation of damping mechanisms of a tip-mass piezoelectric system can be considered toward the piezoresistor force sensor system to develop a theoretical-numerical model for uniaxial loading (excitation). 
Theory of a tip-mass piezoelectric system can now be translated to a cantilevered piezoresistive system to study electromechanical and electrostrictive effects by applying similar boundary conditions and assumptions. 
This is done by defining the cantilevered piezoresistive sensor as an bending electrostrive transducer by considering only the forward piezoelectric effect, which is related to the piezoresistive effect, and disregarding the inverse piezoelectric effect. 
In other words, we only consider the feedback of the mechanical stimulation or excitation transduced into a power signal (which we observe/study as relative resistance change) and hold all other electromechanical quantities, energies, and degrees of freedom produced by the input power constant or reduced to zero. 
Here we characterize the damping response from a commercial piezoelectric transducer when
 it is subjected to free-vibrations. The problem under study is an electromechanical problem and
 hence a combination of dimensionless parameters including the natural frequency of the system,
 are used to study and understand the damping characteristics of the tip-mass-piezoelectric system.
 To directly visualize the tip displacement on the voltage generated, high-speed imaging studies of the cantilever are
 performed in addition to separate measurements of the voltage response using an oscilloscope. 
\subsection{Sensing Kirigami Principles}
By employing programmable lasercutters and papercutters, we can adjust the mechanical properties of the paper substrate by applying principles of sensing kirigami.
Paper is a modest material with rich affordances for craft and design. 
Paper comes in many different compositions. It can be shaped into 
delicate objects that move with the slightest touch; or constructed into 
robust structures that support a building. As designers and 
researchers, we are attracted to the qualities of paper for facilitating 
tangible interactions. We are particularly curious about kirigami  a Japanese term we borrow to describe cutting, folding and 
bending flat sheets of paper into three-dimensional forms. Kirigami 
enables us to shape paper into pliable structures that move dynamically 
to afford tangible interactions. Our material-driven exploration is 
anchored in carbon-coated paper—an electrically resistive material 
affected by folding and bending. We investigated two types of paper for 
sensing tangible interactions and harnessed insights gained from them 
to inform three design propositions—tangible interfaces that range  
from part to product.

\subsection{Theoretical Underpinnings:Theorems and Analytical Solutions}
To construct our ideal model, we make a number of assumptions and assume ideal conditions in all aspects of the experiment. The sensor therefore is a finite cantilevered beam with fixed-free boundary conditions and uniaxial loading (or excitation) on the top surface-place. Assuming an ideal thermo-mechanical system, the response to work-energy input on the MEMS is recorded as total deformation of the body $\varepsilon$ and dimensionless power signal $R^*$. Therefore we define our principal axes in Fig [4] where longitudinal (beam-wise) strain $\varepsilon_x$ is measured as well as lateral strain $\varepsilon_y$. The degree of deformation (i.e. Polarization) at a plane/spot is the total body deformation $\delta \propto \varepsilon$ and surface slope of $\theta$. Equation [15] is a spot deflection approximation where the third term is the dynamic deflection coefficient of the surface $(\frac{Q}{\omega_n^3})^{1/2}$ and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at the natural frequency for the ladder calculated from $\phi(t)$.
Based on the experimental set-up, there are several models of analytical solutions for a cantilevered paper piezoresistor that we can draw inspiration from including a lumped electrostrictive model for a bending transducer, an analytical solution for a two layer beam including a timoshenko, a analytical solution for interlayer slip and effects of shear in a cantilevered paper beam, and finally a composites-computaional Monte Carlo method for simulating piezoresistance with a geometrical-analytical solution.
To construct our ideal model piezoresistivity and investigate electrostrictive effects, we make a number of assumptions and assume ideal conditions
 in all aspects of the experiment. The sensor therefore is a finite cantilevered beam with
 fixed-free boundary conditions and uniaxial loading (or excitation) on the top surface-place.
 Assuming an ideal thermo-mechanical system, the response to work-energy input on the
 MEMS is recorded as total deformation of the body recorded by the feedback signal which is related to the relative resistance change.
