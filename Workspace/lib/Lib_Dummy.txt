[Draft] Yahriel's Personal History Statement

In the intricate tapestry of my life, every thread has been woven with intention, resilience, and a profound dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. My journey, marked by challenges, triumphs, and an unwavering commitment to inclusivity, has shaped my decision to pursue a graduate degree in the interdisciplinary realms of neuroscience, mathematics, and computational sciences.

As I reflect on my personal history, the echoes of my upbringing in a quiet town in Iowa resonate. It was here that I encountered Don, a wise and enigmatic individual born into silence, much like I was in my early years. Don became my guide, introducing me to the "music of silence" and teaching me to find beauty and wisdom in quiet moments. His mentorship was a transformative force, redirecting my perspective and fostering an appreciation for the extraordinary in the ordinary.

My academic journey commenced at the prestigious California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. Caltech, renowned for its rigorous academic standards, provided me with the intellectual tools to decipher the mathematical language underlying the cosmos. However, it was the serendipitous discovery of fractal mathematics that ignited my passion. Fractals, intricate patterns that transcend the ordinary, became my canvas for curiosity, representing the intersection between chaos and order.

Venturing into the realm of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), I honed my skills in precision design and innovation. Yet, it was the interplay between order and chaos, exemplified by fractals, that truly captivated me. This fascination became a driving force, propelling me towards a deeper understanding of mathematical patterns and their application in diverse fields.

My academic pursuits were not devoid of challenges, and I found solace and strength in my mother's unwavering support during moments of darkness. Her guiding question, "What do you see in this darkness, my dear?" prompted me to transform challenges into fresh starts. This resilience became a cornerstone of my academic endeavors, shaping my ability to navigate complexities with a positive outlook.

Embracing an interdisciplinary approach, I integrated my interests in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a passion for mental health. This unique intersection marked a path I was determined to explore further. It was during this journey that I recognized the importance of mentorship and advocacy in academia.

My encounters with mentors played instrumental roles in navigating the labyrinth of academia. Their wisdom, support, and encouragement equipped me with the tools to succeed, instilling in me the value of paying knowledge forward. This commitment to mentorship became a cornerstone of my dedication to uplifting others on their academic paths, with a particular focus on fostering diversity and inclusivity.

As I delved into the complex world of mathematics and mental health research, I realized the significance of creating an inclusive academic environment. My commitment to neurodiversity advocacy extends beyond scholarship; it is a call to inspire individuals with diverse neurological profiles to recognize their potential and thrive in the scientific community. Inclusivity, to me, is not merely a goal but a fundamental principle that enriches the scientific landscape.

The intellectual merit of my research objectives lies in the intersection of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity. With aspirations to pursue a Doctorate in Neuroscience, specializing in Biomedical Data Science, my goals are clear. I aim to develop novel diagnostic tools, personalized treatment approaches, and advocate for neurodiverse individuals within academia and society.

The prospect of obtaining a Fellowship is not just a personal milestone but a validation of my commitment to the convergence of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity. This esteemed award aligns seamlessly with my values, emphasizing innovation and broader impacts.

Upon completing my doctorate, I envision a career in academic research, bridging gaps between mathematics and mental health. My goals extend to mentoring and advocating for neurodiverse individuals, contributing to a future where inclusivity in academia is not just a goal but a reality.

In conclusion, my personal history has sculpted a narrative of resilience, transformation, and an unwavering commitment to diversity in academia. As I stand on the threshold of graduate research, I am eager to delve into the intricate realms of biomedical data science, unveiling the patterns in neural data to transform mental health diagnosis and treatment. The Fellowship represents not only a financial support system but a recognition of my potential to contribute significantly to science and society.

With a heart dedicated to the harmonious interplay between mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity, I submit this Personal History Statement as an invitation to join me on a journey that celebrates the beauty of chaos and the power of inclusivity. Together, we can weave a narrative that resonates with the broader scientific community, one neural pattern at a time.
