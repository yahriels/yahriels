ABSTRACT

The research investigates the impact of incorporating Phase-Change Material (PCM) thin film electrodes in piezoresistive force sensors, comparing them to sensors utilizing conventional low-resistance silver paste electrodes. The effect of this enhancement on sensor fabrication processes, characteristics, and performance is explored.

METHODOLOGY

To address the research objectives, the study employed a comparative approach. Firstly, the fabrication processes of piezoresistive force sensors with PCM thin film electrodes and those with low-resistance silver paste electrodes were thoroughly investigated. This involved examining the materials used, deposition techniques, and sensor assembly procedures.

Furthermore, the characteristics of the sensors were extensively analyzed. This included studying their electrical properties, mechanical stability, and sensitivity to external forces. Special attention was given to the differences arising from the integration of PCM thin film electrodes, such as phase transition behavior and thermal properties.

In terms of performance evaluation, experimental tests were conducted to measure the response of both types of sensors to varying force inputs. This involved utilizing specialized test setups and measurement equipment to capture relevant data. Additionally, statistical analyses were performed to compare the performance metrics of the two sensor configurations.

RESULTS

The results of the study revealed significant differences between the sensors equipped with PCM thin film electrodes and those with conventional silver paste electrodes. Detailed analyses, including tables and consideration of covariates, demonstrated the distinct characteristics and performance profiles of each sensor type.

DISCUSSION

While the findings presented compelling evidence of the impact of PCM thin film electrodes on sensor performance, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. Specifically, the study could not definitively establish a causal relationship between the incorporation of PCM and the observed improvements in sensor behavior. Further research incorporating additional control measures may help address this limitation.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the study provides empirical support for the efficacy of Phase-Change Material thin film electrodes in enhancing the performance of piezoresistive force sensors. Despite inherent limitations, the findings suggest a promising avenue for advancing sensor technology, paving the way for improved sensing capabilities in various applications.

HOW TO WRITE AN METHODOLOGY
> Describe your methodological approach by introducing the way you researched the topic.
> Explain your methods of data collection
> Define each method that you have used for analyzing the topic.
> Select the best and effective method that helped you in gathering the data fast.
> Evaluate and justify your methodological choices.

TIPS FOR WRITING A METHODOLOGY
- Show how and why: Go beyond a simple description of your methods and show how as well as why you used them. This helps demonstrate that you rigorously conducted your research. 
- Draft as you go: Take notes and outline your methodology as you work to make sure you capture all details accurately. The better you record your methods and techniques in real time, the better your methodology will be.
- Focus on you research questions: Relate your methodology choices to the central theme of your research. This shows that you chose the best methods to address the problem raised in your thesis.
- Write for your audience: Craft a methodology that is clearly written and well-structured. Address the audience of your research with good writing, providing more than a list of technical details and procedures.


1. "Help me strike the right balance between providing enough detail to engage readers and avoiding unnecessary jargon in my introduction."
2. "Assist me in constructing an engaging opening hook that captures reader's attention and introduces my research."
3. Guide me in formulating clear aims and objectives for my study by suggesting a list of verbs I can choose from."

Describe your research methodology and provide an overview of how you conducted your study. Explain your data sources and collection methods. Summarize the key findings of your research, and briefly comment on their significance.
- Example: The methodology involved __. Findings revealed ___. The research underscores the importance of ____.
(3.) Implications
Discuss the broader implications of your research, addresseing its ramifications beyond the academic context. Consider who can benefit from your findings and why it matters to the real world.
- Example: The implications of this study include ____.
(4.) Conclusions
Summarize the key contributions your research has made and connect your work to future develpments in the field. This sections serves as a bridge between your research and other work in the discipline. 
- Example: In conclusion, this thesis contributes to ___. As we move forward, this research serves as a ____.




My literature review feels scrappy and fragmented. Can you give me some specific words and phrases I can use to connect the sections together and integrate the material, so it flows better? They should be fill in the gap sentence starters. Please give me 10.

THESIS STATEMENTS
In most research papers, the thesis statement represents the writer's overall argument for the paper, which will be supported and developed in each paragraph. Having a strong or weak thesis can make a significant difference in how well the writer states their claim and defends it, and it can also influence how well the reader understands and follows the argument.
MAKE IT ARGUABLE: Think of potential conter-arguments. If you can find several that seem plausible, then your thesis statement is probably an argument, not a simple statement. Try to make your thesis statement provacative. While you should not try to offend readers, make your argument memorable. 
TELL YOUR READER WHAT THE TOPIC IS: What topic and which points will be focused on throughout the paper?
SUPPORT IT WITH CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION: Strong thesis statement are not dropped into the first paragraph. Discuss relevant information about the topic and "build up" to the argument. This prevents you from having to over-explain in your thesis and better places your argument in a larger discussion of the topic.
MAKE YOUR STANCE CLEAR: Don't treat your argument like a mystery. Instead, ensure that your reader understands your stance on the topic from the very beginning so they will understand how each paragraph fits its your overall argument. When you can use 1st person, verbs like argue, contend, posit, or claim to clearly state your position on the issue (e.g., "I contend that..."). These verbs act as "signal words" that direct the reader to your argument.
BE CLEAR: Remove your thesis from your paper and read it separately. Do you understand yourself? Instead of cryptic or vague language, strive for clarity and specificity. 
SAY IT IN ONE SENTENCE: If you cannot write the thesis in one sentece, try to hone in on your claim. This is a good exercise because it forces you to better understand your own argument.
PUT IT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION: For research papers, the reader should understand how each paragraph supports your stance on the issue. Personal narractives are an exception to this rule.
BE COMPLEX: if you only have one or two points to make in regards to your thesis, can you add details to your argument in order to give yourself "more to write about" as you support it?
USE TOPIC SENTENCES TO RELATE BACK TO YOUR THESIS: A thesis statement is not a stand-alone sentence; it sets up the argument that will be developed in each paragraph/section. Once you have written your thesis statement, make sure that each paragraph's main point clearly supports the thesis. Make sure each supporting section advances the thesis in some way.
