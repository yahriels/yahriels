Statement of Grant Purpose
Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Host Country: Mexico, Field: Molecular & Systems Bioengineering
Project Title: Unraveling the Molecular Code of Natural Antidepressants in Grapes
In the ever-evolving world of scientific inquiry, certain moments emerge as profound intersections of human ingenuity, scientific inquiry, and the enigmatic wonders of nature. Encapsulated within this project is one such moment. With a central focus on unraveling the molecular code of grapes to find the compounds responsible for its potential natural antidepressant properties, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes aims to foster innovation in treatments for mental health disorders and conditions. Also encompassed in the project is an investigation into the nature of schizophrenia and the complexities of neuroplasticity, in hopes of advancing understanding of the mental illness. The overarching goal is to address the mounting global health crisis presented by mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, which have surged to an unprecedented global health crisis significantly diminishing the quality of life for millions and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide.

Yahriel, and the research team at the university Tecnológico de Monterrey endeavor to decode the molecular secrets of nature to improve the human condition, particularly for individuals affected by schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. Yahriel's work represents a convergence of scientific rigor, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a profound commitment to the betterment of human well-being. Furthermore, this research holds the potential to strengthen international collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico. By conducting research at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Yahriel can contribute to the exchange of knowledge and ideas between the two countries, fostering a stronger global community which reflects the essence of the Fulbright mission, emphasizing mutual understanding and collaboration between nations. Yahriel Salinas-Reyes' Fulbright-Garcia Robles Open Study/Research Award proposal represents a unique and ambitious endeavor to explore the natural antidepressant properties of grapes. Grounded in the principles of interdisciplinary research, this project not only has the potential to transform mental health treatment but also to deepen our understanding of the brain's plasticity. It is a testament to the power of collaboration and cultural exchange in the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of human well-being. Yahriel's unwavering commitment to utilizing opportunities to their fullest and to serve as a cultural diplomat, bridging gaps between different fields and nations, promises to unlock the molecular code of nature and take meaningful strides toward a healthier and more fulfilling world for all.  Yahriel's proposal  represents a remarkable opportunity to weave together science, innovation, and compassion in the quest to decipher the extraordinary truths hidden within the universe's code.
Nature’s Chaos Game: An Existentialist Approach (1. Numbers 2. Shapes. Prediction)
Informed by Mathematics and Neurobiology 
Introduction: Mental health disorders represent a profound challenge to contemporary society, impacting millions of lives worldwide. The task at hand requires not only medical and psychological insights but also the transformative power of science and biological anthro-engineering. This proposed research operates at the crossroads of diverse scientific disciplines, with two primary objectives: first, to decode the intricate neurobiological landscape of schizophrenia, and second, to uncover the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of potential natural antidepressants found in grapes. Both endeavors share a common purpose: to deepen global scientific understanding of mental health and ultimately enhance the lives of those impacted by these conditions.
