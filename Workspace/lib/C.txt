The Problem: Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects a small percentage of the population. Professionals in the field of schizophrenia research that will be on our team include psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and geneticists. These professionals work together to study the underlying causes of schizophrenia, including genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors. While there is still much to learn about the etiology of schizophrenia, recent research has provided some insights into the factors that may contribute to its development.

Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Intellectual Framework and Phases of Approach: 
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.
Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.
that will be on our team include psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and geneticists. These professionals work together to study the underlying causes of schizophrenia, including genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors. While there is still much to learn about the etiology of schizophrenia, recent research has provided some insights into the factors that may contribute to its development.
Statement of Grant Purpose Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. Potential Local Collaborators: Here are some professionals in the etiology of schizophrenia that are local and/or near Des Moines, Iowa FIND COLLABORATORS OR DESCRIBE THE IDEAL TEAM MEMBER.
Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field of study captures the essence of Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and psychosis and the idea that chaos theory and theory of confusion may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The project title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language as well as Anthropology-Engineering methods, the proposed scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.
**Project Title:**  "How He Got His Scars: The Nature Physicist Explores Abnormal Human Ingenuity and the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Neurobiological Representations of Schizophrenia and Psychosis."
**Summary:**
The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.
To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.
In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness and confusion, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.

Cover Letter:{
My name is Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, and I’m writing to you regarding a great intellectual opportunity.

My undergraduate development experiences and associated projects helped me develop and fine-tune the skills necessary for a research position such as this one. I have developed research soft skills such as scientific literature review, grant proposal and report writing, and scientific peer-review. Specifically, my experience with researching micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) devices for various aerospace and industrial-related applications, has equipped me with the knowledge, experience, and skills you’re looking for in your ideal candidate. 
My inter-disciplinary experience and research approach also equips me with various engineering and research techniques to tackle challenges such as building safety-enhancing technology; analyzing utility of a design or system; applying computational techniques and implementing optimization decisions; as well as developing high-efficiency (i.e., performance/cost) green technologies to challenge overly — complex and expensive — practices. I see my skills best utilized in roles concerning scientific investigation and instrumentation, exploratory data methods, experimental design, signals and information systems, software development, flight control systems, and dynamical systems.
On the technical side, I have extensive experience working with various software’s and analysis tools, namely MATLAB, Python, Java, C++, Linux, Latex, Solidworks Modeling, ANSYS Simulations, Machine Learning and Data-Statistical Methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Signals and Systems (Control Systems) and Deep Learning topics. These skills, in supplement with the theoretical knowledge that I’ve gained, were honed throughout many completed projects; I am confident in this aspect of research assistantship or consultation. 
Through my prior projects, such as the NASA Micro-G Next Challenge, I’ve learnt how to manage my work in a collaborative environment. Furthermore, I understand the intricacies of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how mundane and repetitive my tasks are. 
I look forward to discussing my candidacy with you virtually. If any additional information will help move my application forward, please let me know. Thanks for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
-	Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Aerospace Engineering, 
~ The Rocket Scientist Studying The Science of Madness
