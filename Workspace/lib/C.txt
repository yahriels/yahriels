My name is Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, and I’m writing to you regarding a great intellectual opportunity.

My undergraduate development experiences and associated projects helped me develop and fine-tune the skills necessary for a research position such as this one. I have developed research soft skills such as scientific literature review, grant proposal and report writing, and scientific peer-review. Specifically, my experience with researching micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) devices for various aerospace and industrial-related applications, has equipped me with the knowledge, experience, and skills you’re looking for in your ideal candidate. 
My inter-disciplinary experience and research approach also equips me with various engineering and research techniques to tackle challenges such as building safety-enhancing technology; analyzing utility of a design or system; applying computational techniques and implementing optimization decisions; as well as developing high-efficiency (i.e., performance/cost) green technologies to challenge overly — complex and expensive — practices. I see my skills best utilized in roles concerning scientific investigation and instrumentation, exploratory data methods, experimental design, signals and information systems, software development, flight control systems, and dynamical systems.
On the technical side, I have extensive experience working with various software’s and analysis tools, namely MATLAB, Python, Java, C++, Linux, Latex, Solidworks Modeling, ANSYS Simulations, Machine Learning and Data-Statistical Methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Signals and Systems (Control Systems) and Deep Learning topics. These skills, in supplement with the theoretical knowledge that I’ve gained, were honed throughout many completed projects; I am confident in this aspect of research assistantship or consultation. 
Through my prior projects, such as the NASA Micro-G Next Challenge, I’ve learnt how to manage my work in a collaborative environment. Furthermore, I understand the intricacies of research work. I can maintain focus on my individual tasks, with full knowledge of how they contribute to the overall research goals, no matter how mundane and repetitive my tasks are. 
I look forward to discussing my candidacy with you virtually. If any additional information will help move my application forward, please let me know. Thanks for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
-	Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Aerospace Engineering, 
~ The Rocket Scientist Studying The Science of Madness
