Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Intellectual Framework and Phases of Approach: 
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.
Phase I: Understanding The Divided Self and Existential Despair
Header: A Trip Through Insanity - a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.
Motivation: Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair. Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreaminess easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 
Stage 1: Alogia – Poverty of Speech and Senses
Stage 2: Autism – Realism and Logicism
State 3: Ambivalence – State of Chaos and Hysteria
State 4: Affect Blunting – Comfortably Numb and Emotionless
Outcome: Pandemonium and Complete Fracturing of The Self and Nature
Accessories: Mania and Madness, Paranoia and Delusions, Psychosis and Schizophrenia 
Revelation: We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love. Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.
Phase II: Unraveling The Nature of Intelligence and Human Ingenuity
Header: Creative people who can't help but explore other mentasl territories are at greater risk, just as someone who climbs a mountain is more at risk than someone who just walks along a village lane. 
Motivation: Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death.
Stage 1: Youthfulness – Vitality and Radiance
Stage 2: Imagination – Idealism and Irrationalism
Stage 3: Curiosity – State of Wonder and Exploration
Stage 4: Dreaminess – Absorption, Abstraction, Distraction, and Forgetfulness
Outcome: Dawn of New Age and Realization of The Natural Self and Frontiers
Accessories: Peace and Tranquility, Freedom and Healing, Joy and Growth
Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.

[Summary of Research Proposal]

Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field of study captures the essence of Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and psychosis and the idea that chaos theory and theory of confusion may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The project title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language as well as Anthropology-Engineering methods, the proposed scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.
**Project Title:**  "Nature's Chaos Game: The Rocket Scientist Explores Abnormal Human Ingenuity and the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Neurobiological Representations of Schizophrenia and Psychosis."
**Summary:**
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness and chaos, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of insanity and confusion as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease or psychotic behaviors (i.e. a common sympton of schizophrenic traits), schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. Comprehensively, the label of **Madness and Confusion is defined as a naturally sane reaction to an insane world**. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia/psychosis and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.
Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.
The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.
To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.
In conclusion, our research proposal "Nature's Chaos Game" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness and confusion, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.

[Research Abstract]
Research Title: 
Unraveling the Neurobiological Landscape of Schizophrenia: A Multidisciplinary Approach Informed by Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction
Abstract:
In the realm of advancing neuroscience, public and global health, molecular and biotechnology systems engineering, and biomedical data science and informatics, the enigma of schizophrenia stands as both a challenge and an opportunity for scientific exploration. This proposal seeks to illuminate the intricacies of schizophrenia through a rigorous scientific method, integrating the foundational elements of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction into the fabric of our investigative framework.
1. Numbers: Data Capture and Monte Carlo Integration
Our scientific journey commences with an unwavering commitment to numerical precision. Employing state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we will embark on an exhaustive data capture initiative. Through the meticulous acquisition of neuroanatomical, neurodivergent, and neurophysiological data from diverse populations, our objective is to construct an extensive and multidimensional dataset that encapsulates the nuanced dimensions of schizophrenia. This reservoir of data will form the bedrock upon which our mathematical modeling and scientific inquiries will be founded.
To navigate the inherent complexity of this venture, we will harness the power of Monte Carlo Integration techniques, effectively engaging probabilistic simulations. This methodological approach will enable us to traverse the intricate interplay of variables within the neural landscape of schizophrenia, accounting for the stochastic nature of neurobiological phenomena. By fusing data-driven insights with probabilistic modeling, our aim is to unveil the concealed patterns and emergent behaviors that underlie the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
2. Shapes: Mandelbrot Set and Fractal Geometry
In our pursuit of understanding, we delve into the realm of geometric complexity. Schizophrenia, akin to the enigmatic Mandelbrot set, manifests self-similarity across multiple scales. We shall leverage the mathematical elegance of fractal geometry to explore the recursive patterns inherent in neurobiological representations of schizophrenia. By quantifying the fractal dimensionality of neural structures and their aberrations, we aspire to elucidate the underlying geometrical signatures of this intricate disorder.
Fractal analysis will provide us with a potent lens through which we can discern the intricate geometries of neural connectivity, unraveling the non-linear relationships that define the topological architecture of the schizophrenic brain. Through the synergy of fractal geometry and neuroimaging data, our goal is to unearth novel insights into the spatial organization of neuroanatomical features, shedding light on the fractal nature of neurodivergence.
3. Prediction: Dimensional/Spectral Analysis to Understand Causality and Correlation
As we navigate the labyrinthine landscape of schizophrenia and psychosis, our scientific odyssey extends to the realm of prediction and understanding causality. Employing advanced dimensional and spectral analysis techniques, we aim to disentangle the intricate web of causative factors and correlations that govern the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
Dimensional analysis will empower us to identify the critical dimensions that exert a profound influence on the emergence and progression of schizophrenic traits. By dissecting the spectral signatures of neural activity within these dimensions, we seek to unveil the underlying dynamics that govern causality within the realm of neurodivergence.
Our multidisciplinary approach transcends traditional psychiatric narratives, aligning with R.D. Laing's existential perspective that recognizes the value of personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked. Through the harmonious integration of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction, we aspire to illuminate the neurobiological essence of schizophrenia, uncovering correlations and causalities within the active phase-matter of schizophrenic traits. This holistic understanding will not only advance scientific practice but also inform precise health diagnoses and innovative treatments, ultimately propelling the field of global public health forward.

Graduate Research Plan Statement
Nature's Chaos Game: A Transdisciplinary Approach Integrating Neuroscience, and Anthro-engineering 
Introduction: In contemporary society, the profound impact of mental health disorders has left millions of lives in turmoil. Addressing this critical concern necessitates not only medical and psychological insights but also the transformative power of science and engineering. My proposed research aims to develop innovative computational methods and tools that optimize structural performance and safety, with a specific focus on Biological Anthroengineering. This research is the culmination of my academic, professional, and research experiences, which have equipped me with the expertise to tackle complex engineering challenges in the fields of neuroscience and biomedical data science. 
Research Plan: The primary objective of my research is to develop advanced computational tools that can optimize Biological Anthroengineering. This involves integrating modern design principles, advanced materials, and structural analysis methods to enhance the performance, efficiency, and safety of neuroimaging systems.

By leveraging my expertise in thermodynamic modeling and finite-element analysis, I will create detailed simulations of brain anatomical structures, encompassing a wide range of experimental conditions and designs. Entropy, represented by S, is a measure of morphology or order in the system, ∂S≡ N; I validate this mathematical theorem with Chaos Theory: [4] Chaos-Game: x_(n+1)=λx_n (1-x_n ), [5] Mandelbrot-Set: Z_(n+1)=Z_n^2+C, and [6] Fractals: D=log⁡N/log⁡S. Additionally, my background in signals and control systems engineering will enable the development of advanced control mechanisms to enhance adaptability and safety in these structures. Robotics and electrical engineering skills will facilitate the automation and control of aerospace systems.

[Draft] Yahriel's Personal History Statement

In the intricate tapestry of my life, every thread has been woven with intention, resilience, and a profound dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. My journey, marked by challenges, triumphs, and an unwavering commitment to inclusivity, has shaped my decision to pursue a graduate degree in the interdisciplinary realms of neuroscience, mathematics, and computational sciences.

As I reflect on my personal history, the echoes of my upbringing in a quiet town in Iowa resonate. It was here that I encountered Don, a wise and enigmatic individual born into silence, much like I was in my early years. Don became my guide, introducing me to the "music of silence" and teaching me to find beauty and wisdom in quiet moments. His mentorship was a transformative force, redirecting my perspective and fostering an appreciation for the extraordinary in the ordinary.

My academic journey commenced at the prestigious California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. Caltech, renowned for its rigorous academic standards, provided me with the intellectual tools to decipher the mathematical language underlying the cosmos. However, it was the serendipitous discovery of fractal mathematics that ignited my passion. Fractals, intricate patterns that transcend the ordinary, became my canvas for curiosity, representing the intersection between chaos and order.

Venturing into the realm of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), I honed my skills in precision design and innovation. Yet, it was the interplay between order and chaos, exemplified by fractals, that truly captivated me. This fascination became a driving force, propelling me towards a deeper understanding of mathematical patterns and their application in diverse fields.

My academic pursuits were not devoid of challenges, and I found solace and strength in my mother's unwavering support during moments of darkness. Her guiding question, "What do you see in this darkness, my dear?" prompted me to transform challenges into fresh starts. This resilience became a cornerstone of my academic endeavors, shaping my ability to navigate complexities with a positive outlook.

Embracing an interdisciplinary approach, I integrated my interests in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a passion for mental health. This unique intersection marked a path I was determined to explore further. It was during this journey that I recognized the importance of mentorship and advocacy in academia.

My encounters with mentors played instrumental roles in navigating the labyrinth of academia. Their wisdom, support, and encouragement equipped me with the tools to succeed, instilling in me the value of paying knowledge forward. This commitment to mentorship became a cornerstone of my dedication to uplifting others on their academic paths, with a particular focus on fostering diversity and inclusivity.

As I delved into the complex world of mathematics and mental health research, I realized the significance of creating an inclusive academic environment. My commitment to neurodiversity advocacy extends beyond scholarship; it is a call to inspire individuals with diverse neurological profiles to recognize their potential and thrive in the scientific community. Inclusivity, to me, is not merely a goal but a fundamental principle that enriches the scientific landscape.

The intellectual merit of my research objectives lies in the intersection of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity. With aspirations to pursue a Doctorate in Neuroscience, specializing in Biomedical Data Science, my goals are clear. I aim to develop novel diagnostic tools, personalized treatment approaches, and advocate for neurodiverse individuals within academia and society.

The prospect of obtaining a Fellowship is not just a personal milestone but a validation of my commitment to the convergence of mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity. This esteemed award aligns seamlessly with my values, emphasizing innovation and broader impacts.

Upon completing my doctorate, I envision a career in academic research, bridging gaps between mathematics and mental health. My goals extend to mentoring and advocating for neurodiverse individuals, contributing to a future where inclusivity in academia is not just a goal but a reality.

In conclusion, my personal history has sculpted a narrative of resilience, transformation, and an unwavering commitment to diversity in academia. As I stand on the threshold of graduate research, I am eager to delve into the intricate realms of biomedical data science, unveiling the patterns in neural data to transform mental health diagnosis and treatment. The Fellowship represents not only a financial support system but a recognition of my potential to contribute significantly to science and society.

With a heart dedicated to the harmonious interplay between mathematics, mental health, and neurodiversity, I submit this Personal History Statement as an invitation to join me on a journey that celebrates the beauty of chaos and the power of inclusivity. Together, we can weave a narrative that resonates with the broader scientific community, one neural pattern at a time.
