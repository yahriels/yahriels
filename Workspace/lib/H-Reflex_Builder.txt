EXECUTIVE TASK: HELP ME MAKE AN ENTRY FOR "Yahriel Salinas-Reyes" in the excel sheet similar to the example above written this is with Pre-clinical research performing experiments with lab rats with motivation to eventually translate this research to clinical application in human subjects. The goal of these experiments is to find a elicit the soleus H-Reflex (Hoffman-Reflex) and operantly condition the H-reflex by up-conditioning and down-conditioning the H-reflex with a reward such as food pellet or Vaguas Nerve Stimulation (VNS) reward. These are continuous motor unit recordings of EMG activity spike times that correspond to the VNS stimulation, followed by the spike the principal Motor Unit Response (M Wave), followed by the spike of motor response of the Hoffman-Reflex (H Wave), that is captured in the EMG activity of the motor unit responses of a single trial. We are conducting pilot studies to observe soleus EMG in rats and operantly condition their soleus H-reflex paired with VNS reward and identify the spike times of the corresponding M Wave and H Wave, as an indicator of periphery response of the motor unit behavior of the Hoffman-Reflex (HR) Response.
Think about the responses, then give me the complete and full solution based on my project notes. 

This project and set of experiments is heavily based on the pre-clinical model of this paper:

Additional Study Design Notes
Research Context:
The primary goal of this study is to investigate if operant conditioning of the soleus H-reflex in rats, reinforced with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) as a reward, can be used to modify motor unit recruitment patterns. This study seeks to examine whether changes in H-wave amplitude, representing the H-reflex, serve as an indicator of peripheral motor response to conditioning stimuli, potentially leading to applications in neurorehabilitation. The study is motivated by translational applications as described in foundational research on motor learning and reflex plasticity.

Hypotheses Formulation:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): VNS-based operant conditioning has no effect on the amplitude of the H-reflex (no significant increase/decrease).
Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): VNS-based operant conditioning causes a significant increase (up-conditioning) or decrease (down-conditioning) in the H-reflex amplitude.
Assumptions and Checks:
The soleus EMG activity remains consistent within trials, with M-wave amplitude unchanged by external factors.
Background EMG level stability and absence of confounding noise or signal artifacts in the recording system.
Normal distribution of reflex amplitude data, allowing for parametric testing when appropriate.

 H-Reflex Operant Conditioning Project Project Notes :{
The Hoffmann reflex, also known as the H-reflex, is an electrical reflex that measures a muscle's response to stimulation of the afferent nerve: 
How it works
When a nerve is stimulated electrically, action potentials are sent to the spinal cord, which causes motoneurons to reach threshold and contract the extrafusal muscle. 
What it measures
The H-reflex is a measure of alpha motoneuron (αMN) excitability. It can be used to assess how the nervous system responds to a variety of conditions, including neurologic conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, pain, and exercise training. 
How it's measured
The H-reflex and any preceding M wave are usually measured electromyographically. The normal H-reflex latency ranges from 34 to 35 milliseconds, but depends on the patient's age, height, and limb length. 
How it's different from the spinal stretch reflex
The H-reflex is similar to the spinal stretch reflex, but it bypasses the muscle spindle. 

Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) is a peripheral reflex:
Explanation
The H-reflex is a peripheral reflex that's triggered by electrically stimulating a peripheral nerve. The stimulation activates the Ia fibers, which then activate the motoneurons in the spinal cord. This produces a muscle response, which is recorded using electromyography (EMG).
Purpose
The H-reflex is a diagnostic tool that measures the function of the peripheral and central nervous systems. It can be used to monitor the gray matter at the level of the reflex, and to estimate the conduction velocity of the monosynaptic reflex arc.
H-index and H/M ratio
The H-index and H/M ratio are two measurements used to analyze the H-reflex:
H-index: The relative latency between the H- and M-waves
H/M ratio: The ratio of the magnitudes of the maximum peak-to-peak H- and M-waves 



Here are the notes and goals of my project: 
We are modeling a H-Reflex Conditioning Operant System Architecture to create a GUI app called H-Reflex App that is heavily modeled off of this paper: Motor learning changes the axon initial segment of the spinal motoneuron (Link: https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP283875) and this specific section to perform simultaneous recording and stimulation of Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy with H-Reflex Conditioning: 
Stimulus delivery and data collection were controlled by a computer that monitored soleus EMG activity (sampled at 5000 Hz) continuously for the entire period of data collection. The soleus H-reflex was elicited as follows. Whenever the absolute value (equivalent to the full-wave rectified value) of background (i.e. ongoing) EMG activity in the soleus muscle remained within a pre-defined range for a randomly varying 2.3–2.7 s period, the computer initiated a trial. The EMG range was based on the rat's typical soleus EMG level as it moved about the cage; it was typically 1–2% of the maximum possible EMG activity as assessed by the maximum M wave (i.e. the direct muscle response; Pierrot-Deseilligny & Burke, 2012). In each trial, the computer stored the most recent 50 ms of soleus EMG activity (i.e. the background EMG interval), delivered a monophasic stimulus pulse (typically 0.5 ms in duration) through the cuff on the posterior tibial nerve, and stored soleus EMG activity for the next 100 ms. Pulse amplitude was initially set just above M-wave threshold; it was subsequently automatically adjusted by the computer after each trial to maintain M-wave size unchanged throughout the entire period of data collection. Thus, the background EMG (reflecting soleus motoneuron tone at the time of H-reflex elicitation) and the M-wave (reflecting the effective strength of the nerve-cuff stimulus) remained stable throughout data collection.
Under the control mode, the computer simply digitized and stored the absolute value of EMG activity from the soleus muscle for 100 ms following nerve stimulation. Under the soleus H-reflex conditioning mode, it gave a food-pellet reward 200 ms after stimulation if EMG amplitude in the H-reflex interval (typically 6–10 ms after stimulation) was above (H-reflex up-conditioning mode) or below (H-reflex down-conditioning mode) a criterion value. The criterion was set and adjusted daily as needed so that the rat received an adequate amount of food (∼1000 pellets/day for a 500 g rat). H-reflex size was calculated as average EMG amplitude in the H-reflex interval minus average background EMG amplitude and was expressed in units of average background EMG amplitude.
Each rat was first exposed to the control mode for 20 days to determine the control H-reflex size, and then exposed to the up-conditioning (HRup rats) or down-conditioning (HRdown rats) mode for 50 days. The last 10 control-mode days and the last 10 up- or down-conditioning days (i.e. days 41–50 of conditioning) provided the data used to determine the impact of H-reflex conditioning on soleus H-reflex size. Average final (days 41–50) H-reflex size was calculated as a percentage of the control H-reflex size. Successful H-reflex conditioning was defined as a change of at least 20% in the correct direction (i.e. to ≥120% for HRup rats, to ≤80% for HRdown rats) (Wolpaw et al., 1993; Chen & Wolpaw, 1995). Thus, the rats fell into five groups: naive control (NC) rats; successful HRup (US) rats; failed HRup (UF) rats; successful HRdown (DS) rats; and failed HRdown rats (DF) rats. “


Research Question and Introduction:
The study investigates how operant conditioning of the soleus H-reflex, enhanced by VNS and food-pellet rewards, impacts motor unit recruitment patterns in rats. The primary outcome is the change in H-wave amplitude, which reflects the peripheral motor response to conditioning stimuli, measured through continuous EMG recordings.

Identify Variables:
Independent Variable (IV): Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)
Dependent Variable (DV): H-wave amplitude
Data Levels:
IV Type: Continuous
DV Type: Continuous
Outcome Measurement:
The outcome of interest is the H-wave amplitude, assessed through electromyographic recordings during H-reflex trials.

Statistical Analysis:
The appropriate statistical analysis will be conducted using a two-sample t-test to compare H-wave amplitudes between control and conditioning phases.

Hypotheses Formulation:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): VNS-based operant conditioning has no effect on the amplitude of the H-reflex.
Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): VNS-based operant conditioning causes a significant increase or decrease in the H-reflex amplitude.
Hypothesis Testing:
Statistical testing will be performed using a two-sample t-test to evaluate differences in H-wave amplitudes.

Assumptions Check:
Normality: The distribution of H-reflex amplitude data should be normal.
Independence: Each measurement should be independent of the others.
Homogeneity of Variance: Variances between groups should be equal.
