EXECUTIVE TASK: HELP ME MAKE AN ENTRY FOR "Yahriel Salinas-Reyes" in the excel sheet similar to the example above written by Austin Bollinger (who is working in the same lab and does similar research but Yahriel works with Pre-clinical research performing experiments with lab rats while Austin works on the clinical side with human subjects). Yahriel's goal of his experiment is to find a diaphragm biomarker for VNS which is related to motor unit recording where we are conducting pilot studies to observe diaphragm EMG in rats while awake to monitor effects of VNS of respiration and observe if there is a biomarker for VNS by looking at the periphery response of the Hering-Breuer Response.
Think about the responses, then give me the complete and full solution based on my project notes. 

Yahriel's Project draws heavily and is modeled off of this paper: Use of a physiological reflex to standardize vagal nerve stimulation intensity improves data reproducibility in a memory extinction assay / Brain Stimulation

dEMG Biomarker (Diaphragmatic EMG) to Observe Respiration Project Notes :{
Here are the notes and goals of my project: Objectives and Goals of Experiments; VNS-induced apnea project  Goal: Develop system to monitor diaphragm respiration (dEMG) & deliver VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation)  simultaneously for continuous recordings.  


Explanation of Key Elements:
Unbiased Research Question (B): The core of the research is to explore whether there is a physiological biomarker for VNS efficacy in diaphragm electromyography (dEMG). This addresses a gap in the literature, particularly in finding an easily measurable marker that indicates the success of VNS during preclinical trials in rats.

Biased Research Question (C): Here, the biased question refines the hypothesis to focus specifically on how VNS can induce a known physiological reflex (the Hering-Breuer reflex) as an indicator of successful VNS engagement. This reflects the hypothesis that changes in dEMG can be linked to VNS-induced reflexive actions.

Is the study experimental? (E): Yahriel’s study involves direct manipulation of the VNS parameters to observe the physiological responses in rats, making it an experimental study.

Primary Independent Variable (F): The independent variable is the intensity of the VNS delivered to the rats, as the study examines how different levels of stimulation impact diaphragmatic EMG responses.

Outcome Variable (I): The primary outcome variable is the diaphragm EMG activity. Specifically, Yahriel is measuring how VNS changes the electromyographic signals of the diaphragm, focusing on identifying a threshold for the Hering-Breuer reflex.


Outcomes of EMG Biomarker
    - Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) increases cortical motor coherence
    - Delta F: Recruitment-derecruitment interval of motor unit firing rates

Outcomes of Additional Physiological Measurements (dEMG to Monitor Respiration)
    - Respiration: could show a decrease in peak amplitude when paired with VNS, due to the recruitment of the Hering-Beruer (HB) Effect.

Main Takeaways:
    - We know VNS + Rehabilitation works in multiple neurological deficit individuals
        - Causes increase in synaptic reorganization and recruitment of neurons for specific tasks
        - No biomarker to identify physiological changes to VNS in Humans, only recovery metrics
    - Physiological monitoring during VNS may show effects on EEG, EMG respiration, ECG, etc.
        - EEG: Evoked potentials and change in specific frequency bands
        - EMG: Increase in delta F and cortical muscular coherence 
        - Respiration: Reduction in amplitude during VNS (Hering-Breuer reflex)
        - ECG: Heart rate drop and reduction of arrythmias
        - Identify acute and long-term changes due to different VNS parameters
    - Use acute changes to predict long-term changes to identify specific VNS parameters per personal
        - Retroactively confirm participant's best parameter 
        - Future clinical trial to confirm predictions of parameters
    - The merit of monitoring respiration is to check that VNS is working correctly and effectively or is present in other therapies used here in the lab and to develop personalized parameter sets for each patient.




General Idea: Record  diaphragm respiration while rats are awake to monitor identify which VNS amplitude causes the Hering Breuer Reflex (HBR) [30 Hz Freq.] (and to eventually perform with jaw experiments)
--> Use threshold of HBR to set VNS amplitude based on their HBR threshold     My Project  overview called dEMG VNS Biomarker In-Vivo Validation uses *Respiration Response to create ---> Personalized parameter set for plasticity and recovery in patients* It Consists of 5 steps. Step 1: Acute Effects of VNS on Respiratory (Anesthetized) "LC (Locus coeruleus) System" (Animal) Step 2: Acute Effects of VNS on Respiratory (Awake) "LC System" (Animal) Step 3: Jaw VNS: Can respiration optimize VNS for plasticity? Plasticity Experiments (Animal) Step 4: Recovery Model: Can respiration optimize VNS for recovery after stroke? Recovery Experiments (Animal) Step 5: Patients "Personalized VNS" (Clinical)
 My Project is heavily based in the application of this paper: Use of a physiological reflex to standardize vagal nerve stimulation intensity improves data reproducibility in a memory extinction assay (link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X21000401) with the following highlights and abstract Highlights 

Abstract
We show that reliable assessment electrode viability for vagal nerve stimulation is essential for long-term experiments.
The vagal afferent Hering-Breuer reflex is a reliable means of confirming effective vagal nerve stimulation.
By contrast change in electrode resistance is a poor indicator of effective vagal nerve stimulation.
When referenced to Hering-Breuer reflex threshold, vagal nerve stimulation accelerated extinction of a contextual memory.
Background
Modulating brainstem activity, via electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), influences cognitive functions, including memory. However, controlling for changes in stimulus efficacy during chronic studies, and response variability between subjects, is problematic.
Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that recruitment of an autonomic reflex, the Hering-Breuer reflex, would provide robust confirmation of VNS efficacy. We compared this to measurement of electrode resistance over time. We also examined whether VNS modulates contextual memory extinction.
Methods
Electrodes for VNS and diaphragm electromyography recording were implanted into anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. When conscious, we measured the electrode resistance as well as the minimum VNS current required to evoke the Hering-Breuer reflex, before, and after, an inhibitory avoidance assay - a two chamber, dark/light model, where the dark compartment was paired with an aversive foot shock. The extinction of this contextual memory was assessed in sham and VNS treated rats, with VNS administered for 30 s at 1.5 times the Hering-Breuer reflex threshold during extinction memory formation.
Results
Assessment of VNS-evoked Hering-Breuer reflex successfully identified defective electrodes. VNS accelerated extinction memory and decreased multiple physiological metrics of fear expression. We observed an inverse relationship between memory extinction and respiratory rate during the behavioural assay. Additionally, no current - response relationship between VNS and extinction memory formation was established.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that reliable, experimental VNS studies can be produced by verifying reflex initiation as a consequence of stimulation. Further, studies could be standardised by indexing stimulator efficacy to initiation of autonomic reflexes.   }
