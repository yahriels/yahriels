 } Project Notes:{Here are the notes and goals of my project: Objectives and Goals of Experiments; VNS-induced apnea project  Goal: Develop system to monitor diaphragm respiration (dEMG) & deliver VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation)  simultaneously for continuous recordings.  

General Idea: Record  diaphragm respiration while rats are awake to monitor identify which VNS amplitude causes the Hering Breuer Reflex (HBR) [30 Hz Freq.] (and to eventually perform with jaw experiments)
--> Use threshold of HBR to set VNS amplitude based on their HBR threshold     My Project  overview called dEMG VNS Biomarker In-Vivo Validation uses *Respiration Response to create ---> Personalized parameter set for plasticity and recovery in patients* It Consists of 5 steps. Step 1: Acute Effects of VNS on Respiratory (Anesthetized) "LC (Locus coeruleus) System" (Animal) Step 2: Acute Effects of VNS on Respiratory (Awake) "LC System" (Animal) Step 3: Jaw VNS: Can respiration optimize VNS for plasticity? Plasticity Experiments (Animal) Step 4: Recovery Model: Can respiration optimize VNS for recovery after stroke? Recovery Experiments (Animal) Step 5: Patients "Personalized VNS" (Clinical)
 My Project is heavily based in the application of this paper: Use of a physiological reflex to standardize vagal nerve stimulation intensity improves data reproducibility in a memory extinction assay (link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X21000401) with the following highlights and abstract Highlights 
•
We show that reliable assessment electrode viability for vagal nerve stimulation is essential for long-term experiments.
•
The vagal afferent Hering-Breuer reflex is a reliable means of confirming effective vagal nerve stimulation.
•
By contrast change in electrode resistance is a poor indicator of effective vagal nerve stimulation.
•
When referenced to Hering-Breuer reflex threshold, vagal nerve stimulation accelerated extinction of a contextual memory.
Abstract
Background
Modulating brainstem activity, via electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), influences cognitive functions, including memory. However, controlling for changes in stimulus efficacy during chronic studies, and response variability between subjects, is problematic.
Objective/Hypothesis: We hypothesized that recruitment of an autonomic reflex, the Hering-Breuer reflex, would provide robust confirmation of VNS efficacy. We compared this to measurement of electrode resistance over time. We also examined whether VNS modulates contextual memory extinction.
Methods
Electrodes for VNS and diaphragm electromyography recording were implanted into anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. When conscious, we measured the electrode resistance as well as the minimum VNS current required to evoke the Hering-Breuer reflex, before, and after, an inhibitory avoidance assay - a two chamber, dark/light model, where the dark compartment was paired with an aversive foot shock. The extinction of this contextual memory was assessed in sham and VNS treated rats, with VNS administered for 30 s at 1.5 times the Hering-Breuer reflex threshold during extinction memory formation.
Results
Assessment of VNS-evoked Hering-Breuer reflex successfully identified defective electrodes. VNS accelerated extinction memory and decreased multiple physiological metrics of fear expression. We observed an inverse relationship between memory extinction and respiratory rate during the behavioural assay. Additionally, no current - response relationship between VNS and extinction memory formation was established.
Conclusion
These data demonstrate that reliable, experimental VNS studies can be produced by verifying reflex initiation as a consequence of stimulation. Further, studies could be standardised by indexing stimulator efficacy to initiation of autonomic reflexes.   }
