Yahriel Salinas-Reyes	

Yahriel Salinas-Reyes’ Intellectual Framework and Phases of Approach: 
The framework consists of two phases to unravel the nature of intelligence.
Phase I: Understanding The Divided Self and Existential Despair
Header: A Trip Through Insanity - a perfectly rational adjustment to an insane world.
Motivation: Schizophrenia cannot be understood without understanding despair. Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreaminess easily. You have to love them to get them to do that. 
Stage 1: Alogia – Poverty of Speech and Senses
Stage 2: Autism –Realism and Logicism
State 3: Ambivalence – State of Chaos and Hysteria
State 4: Affect Blunting – Emotionless and Expressionless
Outcome: Pandemonium and Complete Fracturing of The Self and Nature
Accessories: Mania and Madness, Paranoia and Delusions, Psychosis and Schizophrenia 
Revelation: We are effectively destroying ourselves by violence masquerading as love. Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.
Phase II: Unraveling The Nature of Intelligence and Human Ingenuity
Header: Creative people who can't help but explore other mental territories are at greater risk, just as someone who climbs a mountain is more at risk than someone who just walks along a village lane. 
Motivation: Madness need not be all breakdown. It may also be break-through. It is potential liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and existential death.
Stage 1: Youthfulness – Vitality and Radiance
Stage 2: Imagination – Idealism and Irrationalism
Stage 3: Curiosity – State of Wonder and Exploration
Stage 4: Dreaminess – Absorption, Abstraction, Distraction, and Forgetfulness
Outcome: Dawn of New Age and Realization of The Natural Self and Frontiers
Accessories: Peace and Tranquility, Freedom and Healing, Joy and Growth
Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.

[Summary of Research Proposal]
Project Funding Solicitations: For this project funding I will be soliciting various sources, namely, The NSF-Mercury Project ($20 Mil) Partnership for a degree proposal; The NSF-GRFP; GFSD; The Google Fellowship; as well as Fulbright Open Study/Research Award X National Geographic Storytelling Fellowship, a joint-opportunity for a study abroad experience.  https://www.ssrc.org/programs/the-mercury-project/nsf-mercury-project-partnership/ ; https://us.fulbrightonline.org/fulbright-nat-geo-fellowship
Synopsis: This new interdisciplinary field of study captures the essence of Human Ingenuity, focusing on the exploration of schizophrenia and psychosis and the idea that chaos theory and theory of confusion may serve a function rather than being solely detrimental. The project title also highlights the intersection of psychiatric thought, neuroscience, and social justice, emphasizing the potential global impact of this research. By using captivating and thought-provoking language as well as Anthropology-Engineering methods, the proposed scientific story aims to engage readers and spark their curiosity.
**Project Title:**  "How He Got His Scars: The Nature Physicist Explores Abnormal Human Ingenuity and the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Neurobiological Representations of Schizophrenia and Psychosis."
**Summary:**
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness and chaos, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of insanity and confusion as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease or psychotic behaviors (i.e. a common sympton of schizophrenic traits), schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. Comprehensively, the label of **Madness and Confusion is defined as a naturally sane reaction to an insane world**. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia/psychosis and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.
Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.
The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.
To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.
In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness and confusion, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.
Other Relevant Coursework includes Latin American Anthropology: Race, Class, and Gender at Iowa State University Liberal Arts and Sciences as part of the U.S. Latino/a Studies Program.

[Research Abstract]

In the realm of advancing neuroscience, public and global health, molecular and biotechnology systems engineering, and biomedical data science and informatics, the enigma of schizophrenia stands as both a challenge and an opportunity for scientific exploration. This proposal seeks to illuminate the intricacies of schizophrenia through a rigorous scientific method, integrating the foundational elements of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction into the fabric of our investigative framework.
1. Numbers: Data Capture and Monte Carlo Integration
Our scientific journey commences with an unwavering commitment to numerical precision. Employing state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, we will embark on an exhaustive data capture initiative. Through the meticulous acquisition of neuroanatomical, neurodivergent, and neurophysiological data from diverse populations, our objective is to construct an extensive and multidimensional dataset that encapsulates the nuanced dimensions of schizophrenia. This reservoir of data will form the bedrock upon which our mathematical modeling and scientific inquiries will be founded.
To navigate the inherent complexity of this venture, we will harness the power of Monte Carlo Integration techniques, effectively engaging probabilistic simulations. This methodological approach will enable us to traverse the intricate interplay of variables within the neural landscape of schizophrenia, accounting for the stochastic nature of neurobiological phenomena. By fusing data-driven insights with probabilistic modeling, our aim is to unveil the concealed patterns and emergent behaviors that underlie the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
2. Shapes: Mandelbrot Set and Fractal Geometry
In our pursuit of understanding, we delve into the realm of geometric complexity. Schizophrenia, akin to the enigmatic Mandelbrot set, manifests self-similarity across multiple scales. We shall leverage the mathematical elegance of fractal geometry to explore the recursive patterns inherent in neurobiological representations of schizophrenia. By quantifying the fractal dimensionality of neural structures and their aberrations, we aspire to elucidate the underlying geometrical signatures of this intricate disorder.
Fractal analysis will provide us with a potent lens through which we can discern the intricate geometries of neural connectivity, unraveling the non-linear relationships that define the topological architecture of the schizophrenic brain. Through the synergy of fractal geometry and neuroimaging data, our goal is to unearth novel insights into the spatial organization of neuroanatomical features, shedding light on the fractal nature of neurodivergence.
3. Prediction: Dimensional/Spectral Analysis to Understand Causality and Correlation
As we navigate the labyrinthine landscape of schizophrenia and psychosis, our scientific odyssey extends to the realm of prediction and understanding causality. Employing advanced dimensional and spectral analysis techniques, we aim to disentangle the intricate web of causative factors and correlations that govern the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
Dimensional analysis will empower us to identify the critical dimensions that exert a profound influence on the emergence and progression of schizophrenic traits. By dissecting the spectral signatures of neural activity within these dimensions, we seek to unveil the underlying dynamics that govern causality within the realm of neurodivergence.
Our multidisciplinary approach transcends traditional psychiatric narratives, aligning with R.D. Laing's existential perspective that recognizes the value of personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked. Through the harmonious integration of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction, we aspire to illuminate the neurobiological essence of schizophrenia, uncovering correlations and causalities within the active phase-matter of schizophrenic traits. This holistic understanding will not only advance scientific practice but also inform precise health diagnoses and innovative treatments, ultimately propelling the field of global public health forward.

In conclusion, our research endeavors to unveil the profound mysteries of schizophrenia through the seamless integration of mathematical modeling and multidisciplinary inquiry. By harnessing the power of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction, we aim to transcend the boundaries of traditional psychiatric narratives, embarking on a transformative journey toward a deeper comprehension of neuroanatomy, neurodivergence, and the intricate web of neurobiological disorders. This pioneering approach holds the promise of ushering in a new era of precision medicine and enhanced global well-being.


Statement of Grant Purpose
Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Host Country: Mexico, Field: Molecular & Systems Bioengineering
Project Title: Unraveling the Molecular Code of Natural Antidepressants in Grapes
In the ever-evolving world of scientific inquiry, certain moments emerge as profound intersections of human ingenuity, scientific inquiry, and the enigmatic wonders of nature. Encapsulated within this project is one such moment. With a central focus on unraveling the molecular code of grapes to find the compounds responsible for its potential natural antidepressant properties, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes aims to foster innovation in treatments for mental health disorders and conditions. Also encompassed in the project is an investigation into the nature of schizophrenia and the complexities of neuroplasticity, in hopes of advancing understanding of the mental illness. The overarching goal is to address the mounting global health crisis presented by mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, which have surged to an unprecedented global health crisis significantly diminishing the quality of life for millions and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide.
At its core, the project is driven by the ambition to conduct a comprehensive molecular analysis of grapes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of antioxidants. Grapes have garnered scientific interest due to their potential health benefits and their recent recognition as potential natural antidepressants. Yahriel's unique background in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) equips him with the precision and expertise required to delve into the microscopic realm of chromosomes and molecules—an essential prerequisite for unveiling the genetic secrets grapes hold. To fulfill the project's objectives, advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology systems engineering will be employed. The primary goal is to pinpoint the specific compounds within grapes responsible for their potential antidepressant properties, involving their isolation and characterization to illuminate their mechanisms of action within the brain. The aim is to identify practical applications for mental health treatment by comprehending the genetic and molecular foundation of natural antidepressant production in grapes. 
Concurrently, this research adopts a multifaceted approach to unravel the complexities of schizophrenia, a debilitating and chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits. At the heart of schizophrenia's enduring enigma are Bleuler's four A's: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect blunting. Extensive research has explored the etiology of schizophrenia, leading to the emergence of three prominent theories: genetic, neurodevelopmental, and neurobiological. Each theory offers a distinct perspective on the origins of this complex disorder, making it challenging to pinpoint a single causative factor. Nonetheless, neurobiological theory has gained prominence due to its comprehensive approach, explaining schizophrenia as a result of abnormal brain dysfunctions or structural anomalies. This theory stands on solid scientific ground, holds promise in guiding treatment strategies, transcends cultural and demographic boundaries, and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to alternative theories. Structural and functional abnormalities in key brain systems (i.e., the prefrontal & medial temporal lobes) play a pivotal role in the manifestation of schizophrenia symptoms that are integral to working memory and declarative memory processes. The disrupted functioning contributes to cognitive impairments and emotional dysregulation in individuals with schizophrenia. In the quest to understand schizophrenia, neuroplasticity—the brain's remarkable capacity to adapt and reorganize itself in 
response to learning, experiences, and environmental changes—emerges as a crucial factor operating at various levels, from synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections between neurons is modified, to large-scale changes in brain structure and function. In the context of schizophrenia, neuroplasticity offers hope for improving cognitive functioning and overall quality of life for affected individuals. Research has shown that cognitive remediation therapies— which harness neuroplasticity—can lead to improvements in cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, mitigating some of the cognitive impairments associated with the disorder.
This project is founded on the belief that nature holds the key to addressing complex health challenges, including mental health disorders like depression and schizophrenia, and seeks to explore the potential of grapes as a source of natural antidepressants. One intriguing entry point into the complex world of grape biochemistry is through the study of yeast used in wine production, which plays a pivotal role in the fermentation process, and influences the composition of compounds within grapes. Scientific evidence unveiled that certain molecular compounds in the antioxidants act as natural antidepressants but there lacks initiative to utilize these antioxidant agents in psychiatric institutions and practical methods. By employing advanced techniques such as neuroimaging, fractal geometry, and spectral analysis, the project aims to unveil underlying patterns and causative factors associated with depression and related mental health conditions. The significance of this research extends far beyond the development of new treatments. It encompasses a broader understanding of the intricate relationship between food, biochemistry, and mental health. This knowledge has the potential to inform dietary recommendations that promote mental well-being, potentially reducing the global prevalence of these disorders. 
Yahriel, and the research team at the university Tecnológico de Monterrey endeavor to decode the molecular secrets of nature to improve the human condition, particularly for individuals affected by schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. Yahriel's work represents a convergence of scientific rigor, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a profound commitment to the betterment of human well-being. Furthermore, this research holds the potential to strengthen international collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico. By conducting research at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Yahriel can contribute to the exchange of knowledge and ideas between the two countries, fostering a stronger global community which reflects the essence of the Fulbright mission, emphasizing mutual understanding and collaboration between nations. Yahriel Salinas-Reyes' Fulbright-Garcia Robles Open Study/Research Award proposal represents a unique and ambitious endeavor to explore the natural antidepressant properties of grapes. Grounded in the principles of interdisciplinary research, this project not only has the potential to transform mental health treatment but also to deepen our understanding of the brain's plasticity. It is a testament to the power of collaboration and cultural exchange in the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of human well-being. Yahriel's unwavering commitment to utilizing opportunities to their fullest and to serve as a cultural diplomat, bridging gaps between different fields and nations, promises to unlock the molecular code of nature and take meaningful strides toward a healthier and more fulfilling world for all.  Yahriel's proposal  represents a remarkable opportunity to weave together science, innovation, and compassion in the quest to decipher the extraordinary truths hidden within the universe's code.
