Help me write an email to this professor https://be.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/gu-eon-kang/ https://labs.utdallas.edu/nmbl/emotion-on-motion/ https://labs.utdallas.edu/nmbl/dual-task/. In the email include incorporate some details about your interests: {Subject: Inquiry About Research/Contract Position and Potential PhD Opportunities  I have been accepted into a PhD Science and Engineering Fellowship, in my current situation I am taking a gap year before entering graduate school and am seeking a research/contract position. Beyond the year, I am looking for graduate student research positions for my PhD. My interests in PhD are in neuroscience, bioinformatics, biomedical engineering, with a focus on mental health and neurological disorders (such as schizophrenia, speech pathology, etc.) and I am greatly interested in this lab. 
I align with your broad range of interests includes areas of research committed to []. 
This is because I have direct interest in [ https://labs.utdallas.edu/nmbl/dual-task/ https://labs.utdallas.edu/nmbl/emotion-on-motion/]
Your research makes use of technologies such as []. 

Biomechanics, Gait, Posture, Wearable sensors, Motion analysis, Computational modeling, Finite element analysis, Physical activity, Physiological monitoring
Neurophysiology and Neuroimaging of the Human Brain
Neurological Bases of Motor and Mental Health Disorders
Brain Stimulation and Neurofeedback Training
Signal Processing and Computational Modeling.

This is because I have interest in studying Schizophrenia which is described as four characteristics (Bleuler's 4A's): Alogia (poverty of thought/speech), Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect Blunting. Given your expertise, I am interested in studying the theoretical underpinnings of Alogia and speech pathology in this conditions (schizophrenia). 
In addition, I am passionate about this area of research because I myself have struggled with biomechanics (Gait), numerous soft tissue (fascia) injuries, and other muscoskeletal disorders in part due to posture, intense physical activity training, as well as neurological disorders I faced early in my life. 
I am aligned with the interests of your lab because I am very strong in signals and controls, systems engineering, data science, and particularly strong in finite element analysis & computational modeling with an interest in understanding the neurophysiological, neurological, and neurobiological underpinnings of conditions such as these. Thank you for considering my candidacy and I would like to schedule and informational interview to learn more about your groundbreaking work.}
