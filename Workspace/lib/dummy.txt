Template:{During my work at Bayer, I have developed a strong interest in pursuing a Ph.D.
Having thoroughly researched the responsibilities involved, I discovered many areas where this project's tasks align with my areas of study and personal interests.
This position provides an ideal opportunity for me to further my academic career.

In \replace{[Month, Year]}, I successfully completed my \replace{[master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in control theory at the University]}.
Since \replace{[Month Year]}, I have been employed full-time as a specialist for railway operational safety in the field of electrical engineering at Deutsche Bahn AG.
In this role, I analyze information from committees and various sources on electrical engineering in the context of railway operational safety.
I also worked as a tutor at \replace{[the University]} in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, specifically in the Power Electronics Research Group, for nearly three years.
My teaching responsibilities included conducting office hours for students and independently leading and supervising multiple weekly tutorials and labs on the subject of “Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering.”

During my studies, I gained practical experience through laboratory experiments, which allowed me to develop skills in handling electrical circuits and using various programs such as Matlab/Simulink.
I am also proficient in simulation using Cadence and Eagle, evaluation with Matlab, and text writing using LaTeX.
Furthermore, through a successful project titled \replace{“[XXXXXXXX],”} which resulted in a publication, I further expanded my knowledge in Matlab/Simulink and Python.

I would like to be chosen for this Ph.D. position because I believe that this project allows me to further develop and enhance my research skills at an advanced academic level.
I am fully aware of the dedication and persistence required to achieve outstanding results in this field, and I have gained these attributes through my academic pursuits.
Additionally, I have successfully collaborated on various group projects both during my studies and in my professional experience, demonstrating my ability to work effectively within a team.
Participating in this project would not only allow me to showcase my existing skills but also provide me with an opportunity to acquire new ones.
I would appreciate an invitation to a personal interview.}
