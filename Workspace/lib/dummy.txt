Dear Professor,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Yahriel Salinas-Reyes and I may be an incoming PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering PhD Program at UT Dallas this Fall 2024, I am reaching out to inquire about open research positions in your esteemed lab.

I am inquiring about a position in your laboratory, as I may be admitted as a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering PhD program at UT Dallas this Fall and I am seeking a supervising professor. This past week I have worked closely with the Director & CEO of the National GEM Consortium (for the GEM PhD in Science and Engineering Fellowship) and they have been able to put in a good word with the president of the UT Dallas Science & Engineering to consider my candidacy for a PhD position for Fall 2024. I was encouraged to apply and was able to put in a rush application in consideration to enter a PhD program this Fall 2024. I'm hoping to hear back soon (this week) for my applications to the Biomedical Engineering PhD Program. (Bioengineering)

My primary interests for my PhD are in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and biomedical engineering, with a focus on mental health, disease, and neurological disorders. Your research on how basal ganglia outputs interact with other brain regions to select, initiate, and execute motivated behavior in both health and disease strongly aligns with my academic and professional aspirations.

My background includes a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aerospace Engineering, extensive experience in regulatory science, data science, bioinformatics, and materials science. I am particularly strong in signals and controls, systems engineering, finite element analysis, and computational modeling. These skills enable me to contribute effectively to understanding the neurophysiological, neurological, and neurobiological foundations of various conditions.

If you are willing to meet with me, we can discuss my intellectual and research interests more indepthly and determine if I would be a good fit for your team.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your groundbreaking work and would like to schedule an informational interview to learn more about your research and potential opportunities within your lab.

Thank you for considering my inquiry.

Warm regards,

Yahriel Salinas-Reyes
