Essay

for my PhD, focusing on neuroscience, bioinformatics, and biomedical engineering, with a particular emphasis on mental health, neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and speech pathology. The alignment of your lab's research with my academic and professional aspirations is highly compelling. I am keenly interested in studying schizophrenia, particularly exploring the theoretical underpinnings of Alogia and speech pathology within this condition, characterized by Bleuler's 4A's: Alogia (poverty of thought/speech), Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect Blunting.

Introduction
My journey towards pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas Dallas is driven by a deep commitment to advancing global healthcare through innovative research and engineering solutions with a special interest in translating scientific discovery to real-world application and real-world solutions to benefit society. This essay outlines my academic interests, professional objectives, and the personal growth that has defined my path.

Academic and Professional Objectives
My professional interests focus on advancing science and technology in medical sciences, with a particular emphasis on computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering. My intellectual pursuits encompass the theoretical and neurobiological underpinnings of mental health disorders, auditory processing, and musculoskeletal disorders. I am especially driven by the goal of developing novel solutions to aid individuals suffering from chronic pain and stress.

Academic Background and Transformation
Throughout my academic career, I have continually challenged myself to step out of my comfort zone, seeking growth and development in every endeavor. My undergraduate studies in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University provided me with a strong foundation in engineering principles. However, as I approached the end of my curriculum, I experienced a significant shift in my interests and values.

The aerospace industry primarily focuses on developing military aircraft and weaponry, which conflicted with my core values of serving people and advancing global health. Despite my academic success, I experienced a period of intense self-reflection, leading me to re-evaluate my goals and ultimately choose a path aligned with my passion for biomedical sciences and global healthcare.

Navigating Challenges and Embracing Growth
The discrepancies in my GPA during the last two semesters of my undergraduate studies reflect this challenging period of transition. While my academic performance temporarily declined, this phase was marked by significant personal growth and a deeper understanding of true learning and development. I realized that grades, while important, are not the sole indicators of one's abilities and potential. Instead, qualities such as critical thinking, resilience, and the capacity to accept constructive criticism are far more valuable.

During this period, I learned to listen to myself, continuously re-evaluating my core values and ensuring that my actions aligned with them. This transformation was not easy, but it was necessary for me to become the most authentic version of myself. Embracing this new path, I redirected my focus towards contributing to medical sciences, developing biomedical solutions, and advancing global healthcare.

Research Contributions and Future Aspirations
As an R&D Engineer with over seven years of experience in designing hardware and software solutions, I bring a robust background in various engineering disciplines. My work has encompassed both front-end and back-end technologies, and I have contributed to multiple submitted manuscripts and publications during my undergraduate studies. Notably, I co-authored a manuscript titled "Characterizing Damping Mechanisms in Piezoelectric Wind-Energy Harvesters," submitted to the Journal of Applied Physics in 2023. Additionally, I prepared a first-author manuscript, "Quantum Tunneling Composites: Analytical Monte Carlo Model & Navier-Stokes," submitted to the Applied Physics Journal in 2023.

My long-standing interests in biomedical engineering and neuroscience have led me to focus on advancing stewardship in global healthcare systems. I am particularly passionate about developing therapeutics for chronic pain and stress, understanding the mechanisms underlying mental health disorders, and improving access to healthcare for underserved populations.

Conclusion
Today, I stand before you as a transformed individual, ready to contribute to the University of Texas Dallas's PhD program in Biomedical Engineering. My journey has been marked by significant challenges and profound growth, solidifying my dedication to leveraging my diverse expertise to impact the well-being of individuals worldwide. I am eager to advance science and technology practices in global healthcare systems and medicine, bringing my broad and expansive knowledge set to your esteemed program. Together, we can reach for the stars while raising our communities with us.

-----

Addressing GPA Discrepancies
The lower than expected GPA in my final semesters as an undergraduate at Iowa State University does not fully represent my academic journey or capabilities. It was during this time that I grappled with the ethical implications of my chosen field of Aerospace Engineering. The realization that my work would contribute to military applications clashed with my core values of serving humanity and advancing global health. This internal conflict led to a period of intense self-reflection and transformation.

While my academic performance suffered, this phase was crucial for my personal and professional growth. I realized that true learning extends beyond grades to include critical thinking, resilience, and the ability to accept and grow from constructive criticism. This understanding has been fundamental in my transition to biomedical engineering, where I now strive to develop solutions that align with my values and contribute to global healthcare.

Transition to Biomedical Sciences
The turning point in my career came when I joined the GEM PhD Science and Engineering Fellowship and interned at Bayer R&D in Crop Science. Working with cross-functional teams in Regulatory Science & Affairs within the Toxicology Team, I gained invaluable experience in pharmaceuticals and health solutions. This role reaffirmed my commitment to biomedical sciences and my dedication to advancing global healthcare.

Commitment to Core Values
Faced with the decision to pursue a straightforward academic path or follow my core values, I chose the latter. This decision, though difficult, has led me to a career path that truly aligns with my passion for biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and global health stewardship. I am committed to developing therapeutics for chronic pain and stress, improving healthcare access for underserved populations, and advancing global health systems.

Final Thoughts
Today, I stand as a transformed individual, dedicated to leveraging my expertise to impact global healthcare positively. I am eager to contribute to the PhD program in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas Dallas, where I believe I can advance science and technology practices in medicine. I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience, ready to face new challenges and contribute to the community and the field.
