I am making a Time Series (with predictions) R Presentation that includes all the elements of rubric in a presentation format and a R Script with Sample data and analysis. Now give me information that I can include in the Time Series R Presentation below that will be assessed by the information on the Rubric, and also give me a complete R Script with example Time Series (with Prediction Analysis) of H-Reflex EMG Data. This link was provided as a resource to help with analysis of time series in R: https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/time/ https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1455479/ 

CONTINUE TO BUILD YOUR PRESENTATION OFF OF THIS PRESENTATION BELOW AND CONTINUE WITH THE SAME STYLE AND FORMAT. THEN GIVE ME A COMPLETE R SCRIPT TIME SERIES ANALYSIS (With Prediction) USING THE DATA SET GENERATED IN THE R CODES BELOW, THEN GO BACK THROUGH AND ADD COMMENTS ABOUT HOW EACH STEP AND TEST SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF STATISTICS.

IMPORTANT NOTES TO INFORM TASKS:{We have 3 different observations we are looking at for this R Script with 1 predictor set that we will run ARIMA Forecast and prediction on to predict the size of the H-Reflex, and R Time Series Presentation and each of these observations has its own R Code and Data Generated Set. FOR THE FORECAST AND PREDICTION WITH ARIMA, I WANT THE MODEL/R CODE TO PREDICT THE SIZE OF THE H-REFLEX OR H-WAVE USING THE PREDICT H-REFLEX DATA GENERATE CODE PROVIDED.

1. H-Reflex Baseline: With this data generated there is no H-Reflex Conditioning taking place, this is a baseline measurement (SHAM).

2. H-Reflex Down-conditioning: With this data generated, the H-Reflex is Down-conditioned where the H-Wave of the H-Reflex is lower than the baseline.

3. H-Reflex Up-conditioning: With this data generated, the H-Reflex is Up-conditioned where the H-Wave of the H-Reflex is higher than the baseline.

X. H-Reflex Prediction: With this data generated that will be used for prediction, the H-Reflex is cut off from the data set to allow the H-Reflex or H-Wave to be predicted using ARIMA Forecast and prediction of the H-Wave size.

Stats R Time Series Presentation:{ 
Background
Introduction to EMG and H-Reflex
- Electromyography (EMG) records the electrical activity of muscles, providing insights into neuromuscular function.
- The H-reflex (Hoffmann reflex) is a reflexive muscle response, elicited electrically, that serves as a measure of spinal cord excitability and motor pathway function.
H-Reflex Significance
- H-reflex conditioning is used in research and clinical settings to understand plasticity in motor pathways.
- It is especially relevant for studying motor control, rehabilitation, and adaptive responses in response to repetitive stimuli or training.
Time Series in EMG Analysis
- Time series analysis in EMG studies helps capture trends, detect cycles, and identify specific response events like reflexive muscle responses.
- Analysis often involves examining patterns and comparing different time intervals to assess changes over time.
Goal of Analysis
- The aim of this analysis is to examine changes in H-reflex response amplitude over time as a result of conditioning.
- This involves statistical methods to determine if there is a significant change in H-reflex after conditioning protocols.

Hypothesis Testing for H-Reflex Conditioning in EMG Data
Hypothesis Setup
- To determine if H-reflex conditioning has an effect, we formulate:
    - Null Hypothesis (H₀): H-reflex amplitude does not change with conditioning.
    - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): H-reflex amplitude changes significantly due to conditioning.
Statistical Tests
- Time Series Stationarity Check:
    - Check if the EMG data is stationary (i.e., mean and variance are constant over time) using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. This ensures reliable statistical modeling.
- Autocorrelation Analysis:
    - Autocorrelation helps confirm repetitive patterns in time series data. We analyze auto-correlation to detect cycles or systematic responses in the H-reflex data.
- Mean Comparison Tests:
    - We can use a paired t-test (or non-parametric tests if data distribution is non-normal) to compare pre- and post-conditioning H-reflex amplitudes.
- Confidence Intervals:
    - Calculating confidence intervals for mean H-reflex amplitude helps validate the hypothesis test by showing the range within which the true mean likely falls.
Decision Criteria
- Set a threshold p-value (commonly 0.05) for significance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding conditioning had a measurable effect.
- "Decision: p < 0.05 to reject H₀."
- "Conclusion: Conditioning effect on H-reflex if p-value is significant."

 H-Reflex Operant Conditioning Project Project Notes :{

Additional Study Design Notes
Research Context:
The primary goal of this study is to investigate if operant conditioning of the soleus H-reflex in rats, reinforced with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) as a reward, can be used to modify motor unit recruitment patterns. This study seeks to examine whether changes in H-wave amplitude, representing the H-reflex, serve as an indicator of peripheral motor response to conditioning stimuli, potentially leading to applications in neurorehabilitation. The study is motivated by translational applications as described in foundational research on motor learning and reflex plasticity.
