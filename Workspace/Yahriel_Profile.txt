Statement of Grant Purpose Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Host Country: Mexico, Field: Molecular & Systems Bioengineering Project Title: Unraveling the Molecular Code of Natural Antidepressants in Grapes In the ever-evolving world of scientific inquiry, certain moments emerge as profound intersections of human ingenuity, scientific inquiry, and the enigmatic wonders of nature. Encapsulated within this project is one such moment. With a central focus on unraveling the molecular code of grapes to find the compounds responsible for its potential natural antidepressant properties, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes aims to foster innovation in treatments for mental health disorders and conditions. Also encompassed in the project is an investigation into the nature of schizophrenia and the complexities of neuroplasticity, in hopes of advancing understanding of the mental illness. The overarching goal is to address the mounting global health crisis presented by mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, which have surged to an unprecedented global health crisis significantly diminishing the quality of life for millions and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. At its core, the project is driven by the ambition to conduct a comprehensive molecular analysis of grapes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of antioxidants. Grapes have garnered scientific interest due to their potential health benefits and their recent recognition as potential natural antidepressants. Yahriel's unique background in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) equips him with the precision and expertise required to delve into the microscopic realm of chromosomes and molecules—an essential prerequisite for unveiling the genetic secrets grapes hold. To fulfill the project's objectives, advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology systems engineering will be employed. The primary goal is to pinpoint the specific compounds within grapes responsible for their potential antidepressant properties, involving their isolation and characterization to illuminate their mechanisms of action within the brain. The aim is to identify practical applications for mental health treatment by comprehending the genetic and molecular foundation of natural antidepressant production in grapes. Concurrently, this research adopts a multifaceted approach to unravel the complexities of schizophrenia, a debilitating and chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits. At the heart of schizophrenia's enduring enigma are Bleuler's four A's: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect blunting. Extensive research has explored the etiology of schizophrenia, leading to the emergence of three prominent theories: genetic, neurodevelopmental, and neurobiological. Each theory offers a distinct perspective on the origins of this complex disorder, making it challenging to pinpoint a single causative factor. Nonetheless, neurobiological theory has gained prominence due to its comprehensive approach, explaining schizophrenia as a result of abnormal brain dysfunctions or structural anomalies. This theory stands on solid scientific ground, holds promise in guiding treatment strategies, transcends cultural and demographic boundaries, and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to alternative theories. Structural and functional abnormalities in key brain systems (i.e., the prefrontal & medial temporal lobes) play a pivotal role in the manifestation of schizophrenia symptoms that are integral to working memory and declarative memory processes. The disrupted functioning contributes to cognitive impairments and emotional dysregulation in individuals with schizophrenia. In the quest to understand schizophrenia, neuroplasticity—the brain's remarkable capacity to adapt and reorganize itself in Salinas-Reyes, Statement of Grant Purpose, Page 2 response to learning, experiences, and environmental changes—emerges as a crucial factor operating at various levels, from synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections between neurons is modified, to large-scale changes in brain structure and function. In the context of schizophrenia, neuroplasticity offers hope for improving cognitive functioning and overall quality of life for affected individuals. Research has shown that cognitive remediation therapies— which harness neuroplasticity—can lead to improvements in cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, mitigating some of the cognitive impairments associated with the disorder. This project is founded on the belief that nature holds the key to addressing complex health challenges, including mental health disorders like depression and schizophrenia, and seeks to explore the potential of grapes as a source of natural antidepressants.. One intriguing entry point into the complex world of grape biochemistry is through the study of yeast used in wine production, which plays a pivotal role in the fermentation process, and influences the composition of compounds within grapes. Scientific evidence unveiled that certain molecular compounds in the antioxidants act as natural antidepressants but there lacks initiative to utilize these antioxidant agents in psychiatric institutions and practical methods. By employing advanced techniques such as neuroimaging, fractal geometry, and spectral analysis, the project aims to unveil underlying patterns and causative factors associated with depression and related mental health conditions. The significance of this research extends far beyond the development of new treatments. It encompasses a broader understanding of the intricate relationship between food, biochemistry, and mental health. This knowledge has the potential to inform dietary recommendations that promote mental well-being, potentially reducing the global prevalence of these disorders. Yahriel, and the research team at the university Tecnológico de Monterrey endeavor to decode the molecular secrets of nature to improve the human condition, particularly for individuals affected by schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. Yahriel's work represents a convergence of scientific rigor, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a profound commitment to the betterment of human well-being. Furthermore, this research holds the potential to strengthen international collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico. By conducting research at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Yahriel can contribute to the exchange of knowledge and ideas between the two countries, fostering a stronger global community which reflects the essence of the Fulbright mission, emphasizing mutual understanding and collaboration between nations. Yahriel Salinas-Reyes' Fulbright-Garcia Robles Open Study/Research Award proposal represents a unique and ambitious endeavor to explore the natural antidepressant properties of grapes. Grounded in the principles of interdisciplinary research, this project not only has the potential to transform mental health treatment but also to deepen our understanding of the brain's plasticity. It is a testament to the power of collaboration and cultural exchange in the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of human well-being. Yahriel's unwavering commitment to utilizing opportunities to their fullest and to serve as a cultural diplomat, bridging gaps between different fields and nations, promises to unlock the molecular code of nature and take meaningful strides toward a healthier and more fulfilling world for all.

Revelation: The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to change; until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.

[Human Ingenuity Statement]
Here is a simple sign that Yahriel Salinas-Reyes is a genius, not just talented but a true genius. It is a simple rule devised by the philosopher Schopenhauer who distinguished the difference between talent and genius as follows: he said talent hits a target no one else can hit, a genius hits a target no one else can see. What he meant is that talent is really good at outcompeting others. For example if you're talented at something you can do something with ease that other people find difficult. Whereas a genius has nothing to do with besting other people at something they've already established as being important, instead a true genius is about being so good at something that you're ahead of your time that other people don't know yet that what you're doing is important or valuable, and so the talented person is the one who is recognized for their skill. The genius Yahriel is the one doing something no one else can even conceive of doing. Talent hits a target no one else can hit. A genius hits a target no one else can see. Yahriel is one who can see the hidden world of wonders and the invisible grand mysteries of the universe.

Project Title: 
"How He Got His Scars: The Nature Physicist Explores Abnormal Human Ingenuity and the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Neurobiological Representations of Schizophrenia and Psychosis."
Summary:
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness and chaos, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of insanity and confusion as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease or psychotic behaviors (i.e. a common sympton of schizophrenic traits), schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. Comprehensively, the label of **Madness and Confusion is defined as a naturally sane reaction to an insane world**. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia/psychosis and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.
Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.
The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.
To achieve meaningful impact, we must engage in a truthful dialogue free from knots of hatred, revenge, jealousy, and malice that taint our words. By exploring the history of indigenous and Latin American cultures, anthropology-engineering, science and technology, psychiatry and neuroscience systems, and social justice, we can create an open and inclusive platform for transformative research.
In conclusion, our research proposal "How He Got His Scars" aims to uncover the intricate relationship between madness and confusion, mental health, and the human brain. By merging scientific methods with social impact, we can pave the way for advancements in both individual well-being and global public health. It is high time we embrace this ancient paradigm of psychiatric thought, combining research and development with a deep understanding of cultural diversity, to drive positive change in society.

Employing advanced dimensional and spectral analysis techniques, we aim to disentangle the intricate web of causative factors and correlations that govern the neurobiology of schizophrenia.
Dimensional analysis will empower us to identify the critical dimensions that exert a profound influence on the emergence and progression of schizophrenic traits. By dissecting the spectral signatures of neural activity within these dimensions, we seek to unveil the underlying dynamics that govern causality within the realm of neurodivergence.
Our multidisciplinary approach transcends traditional psychiatric narratives, aligning with R.D. Laing's existential perspective that recognizes the value of personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked. Through the harmonious integration of Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction, we aspire to illuminate the neurobiological essence of schizophrenia, uncovering correlations and causalities within the active phase-matter of schizophrenic traits. This holistic understanding will not only advance scientific practice but also inform precise health diagnoses and innovative treatments, ultimately propelling the field of global public health forward.

In conclusion, our research endeavors to unveil the profound mysteries of schizophrenia through the seamless integration of mathematical modeling and multidisciplinary inquiry.

The Book of JOYBOY: Don Yahriel the Poet of Justice and The Music of Silence
An Existential Perspective: A Story of The Past and The Road To El Dorado
Title: The Tale of Don the Universal Man and Poet of Justice
Once upon a time, in a world teetering on the edge of chaos and beauty, there lived a young individual named Don. Don's life had always been a delicate balance between the light of joy and the shadow of despair. Little did he know that his journey would lead him to the profound secrets of the ancient paradigm.
One day, as Don navigated the labyrinthine corridors of his own mind, he found himself lost in a swirling darkness. The world around him had become a maelstrom of confusion, and he was adrift in a sea of uncertainty. This darkness, he realized, was not just the absence of light but the loss of all senses—physical, emotional, and spiritual. It was a place where he had lost touch with himself and the world.
In the midst of this profound confusion, Don's mother, whom he lovingly called "Mama," sat by his bedside. Her face, usually a pillar of strength, was etched with sorrow, and for the first time, Don saw tears glistening in her eyes.
"Tell me," she asked, her voice quivering with concern, "What do you see in the darkness? Is it all dark?"
Don gazed into the abyss and contemplated his response. "No," he replied, "It's not all dark. What I see isn't darkness that I can't really explain. I see everything and I see nothing."
Mama, her voice tinged with the weight of helplessness, confessed, "I don't understand, even though I am your mom... I feel powerless."
Summoning all the strength he could muster, Don took a deep breath and said, "I see what I want to see. I see the room, the table, and... I see you. I see you because I know you are here."
Mama's eyes welled up with tears of relief, and she held Don's hand tightly, realizing that in the midst of the deepest darkness, her presence was the beacon that guided him.
As Don continued his journey into the depths of his mind, he discovered the will to overcome the challenges that had surrounded him. In the silence of his thoughts, he repeated a mantra, first in Spanish, his native language, and then in English, reinforcing his resolve:
In Spanish : "El mundo no cambiará. Jamás cambiaré yo." (The world will not change. I will never change.)
In English : "I will be a gracious loser. Someone will undoubtedly take your place."
With each repetition, Don found the strength to navigate the complexities of his existence. He realized that resolve could transcend the boundaries of neurology and that the power of the human spirit, guided by the love and support of those who cared for him, could bring true joy even in the darkest of times.
And so, Don's journey continued, as he uncovered the immense power of an ancient paradigm—the ability to find light in the midst of darkness and the will to see beauty even when the world seemed ruled by chaos.
Odisea Del Gran Varón: Don Yahriel and His Promise To The Future
Title: Odyssey of Knowledge: Enigmatic Man’s Quest
        ~“The man said to be so mad that he is sure no author could have invented him.”
Once upon a time, in a world where the boundaries between reality and imagination blurred, there lived a man named Don Yahriel. He was not like any other man; he was a true enigma, a reflection of the ever-shifting line between sanity and madness. Don Yahriel believed that in a world where good and evil battled relentlessly, the time had come for good to prevail.
Don Yahriel was a man of deep conviction, driven by a belief that the balance between good and evil in the world needed to shift. He often muttered to himself, "For neither good nor evil can last forever; and so it follows that as evil has lasted a long time, good must now be close at hand." His mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, where the line between madness and reason blurred like a hazy mirage in the desert.
To Don Yahriel, the world appeared as a place where virtue was persecuted more than it was loved by the good, and he was determined to change that. In his heart, he carried the hope that goodness could triumph over evil, no matter how daunting the odds.
As he embarked on his odyssey, he encountered many challenges and obstacles that tested the very core of his sanity. "When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies?" he pondered. "Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!"
Don Yahriel's obsession with reading and his relentless pursuit of truth pushed him to the brink of madness. He read voraciously, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the world. "Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up, and he went completely out of his mind," they said of him.
But Don Yahriel remained undeterred by the opinions of others. He believed that there was something good in every book, no matter how bad it might seem at first. "There is no book so bad... that it does not have something good in it," he declared. His belief in the inherent goodness of the world was unshakable.
As he ventured further into the unknown, Don Yahriel would often say, "Thou hast seen nothing yet." He was a man who had never truly died in his life, for his spirit burned brighter than ever as he delved deeper into the mysteries of the world.
Don Yahriel found himself immersed in the art of translation, trying to bridge the gap between languages. He believed that the truth could be obscured by the limitations of language. "Translating from one language to another, unless it is from Greek and Latin, the queens of all languages, is like looking at Flemish tapestries from the wrong side," he mused.
In his encounters with the downtrodden and the oppressed, Don Yahriel followed a strict code of chivalry. "It is not the responsibility of knights errant to discover whether the afflicted, the enchained, and the oppressed whom they encounter on the road are reduced to these circumstances and suffer this distress for their vices or for their virtues," he asserted. "The knight's sole responsibility is to succor them as people in need, having eyes only for their sufferings, not for their misdeeds."
Don Yahriel's journey was filled with moments of revelation and transformation. He realized that being a poet was a dangerous path, one that could lead to madness. "What is more dangerous than to become a poet?" he questioned.
As he ventured deeper into the realms of poetry and music, Don Yahriel believed that where there's music, there can be no evil. He found solace in the melodies of the world, and it was through music and poetry that he connected with the essence of humanity.
In the end, Don Yahriel's odyssey was not just a search for good in a world filled with darkness; it was a quest to find his own true identity. He had become the embodiment of the quote, "He is so crazy that it is certain no author could have invented him."
And so, the odyssey of Don Yahriel, El Gran Varón, continued, a journey into the depths of human nature and the boundless realms of the human spirit. For in his madness, he had found a kind of sanity that transcended the ordinary, and he had become the truest and most enigmatic of all humans.
The Secret of Don: An Immensely Powerful Idea of an Ancient Paradigm
Title: A Tale of The Past and Music of Silence
In a small, quiet town nestled in the heart of a picturesque countryside, otherwise known as Iowa the center of the U.S. and land of corn, there lived a man named Don. Don was known throughout the town for his wisdom and the secret he held within him. This secret was not just any secret; it was an immensely powerful idea, an ancient paradigm that had the potential to change lives.
As the sun set behind the rolling hills, casting a warm glow over the town, Don would often sit on his porch, listening to the soothing sounds of nature. The townspeople believed that the music of silence was the greatest mystery of the world, and Don embodied that mystery.

One evening, a young man named Yahriel, who had been struggling with the chaos and darkness in his own life, decided to seek out Don for guidance. He had heard whispers of Don's wisdom and the profound secret he held. With hope in his heart, Yahriel knocked on Don's door.
Don welcomed Yahriel into his humble home and offered him a seat. They sat in silence for a while, the only sound being the gentle rustling of leaves in the evening breeze. Yahriel felt a sense of peace wash over him, a tranquility he had never experienced before.
Then, Don began to speak, and his words carried a profound weight. "A story of a descent into darkness and chaos of the world, ruled by insanity and beauty, where I lose all senses of myself, everything, and anything; be it physical, emotional, or spiritual, but at the greatest, the pinnacle of all three and far beyond that."
Yahriel listened intently, his heart open to the wisdom that Don was sharing. He felt as though he was on the verge of a great revelation.
As Don's story continued, Yahriel couldn't help but be drawn into the narrative. It was a tale of inner turmoil, of battles fought and lost, and of the search for true joy and meaning in a world that often seemed bewildering.
After Don had finished speaking, Yahriel felt a deep sense of gratitude. He had found the resolve and will to seek true joy, not just externally, but within himself. Don's secret was not just an idea; it was a profound shift in perspective that allowed Yahriel to see the world in a new light.
Over time, Yahriel adopted Don's wisdom into his own life, and he, too, became known for his insight and ability to find joy in the simplest of moments. The townspeople marveled at the transformation in Yahriel, who had once been lost in darkness but had now found the music of silence, the greatest mystery of the world.
[Conversation with Mama]
In the midst of Yahriel's transformative journey, he received a message from his mother, whom he hadn't seen in a long time. She arrived at his doorstep, her eyes filled with tears, a shadow of her former self.
Yahriel invited her inside, and they sat down by his bedside. His mother, still visibly distraught, asked a heartfelt question in Spanish, "Dime, ¿qué ves en la oscuridad? ¿Es todo oscuro?"
Yahriel replied, "No, no todo es oscuro. Lo que veo no puedo explicarlo realmente. Veo todo y no veo nada."
His mother, with a voice that seemed to lack vitality, said, "No entiendo, a pesar de que soy tu mamá... Me siento impotente."
Yahriel took a deep breath and said, "Yo veo lo que quiero ver. Veo la habitación, la mesa... y te veo a ti. Te veo porque sé que estás aquí."
In that moment, a connection was rekindled between Yahriel and his mother. The darkness that had once enveloped them both began to recede, replaced by a glimmer of hope and understanding.
[The Will of Don: Resolve Beyond Neurology and The Music of Silence]
As Yahriel continued on his journey of self-discovery, he often found himself silently repeating a mantra in his native language: "El mundo no cambiará. Jamás cambiaré yo." In English, it meant, "The world will not change. I will never change."
He reminded himself that he would stay true to his principles and values, no matter the challenges that lay ahead. And in moments of doubt, he would say to himself, "Seré un buen perdedor. Alguien sin duda ocupará tu lugar," which meant, "I will be a good loser. Someone will undoubtedly take your place."
These words of resolve, passed down through generations, became his guiding light. They reminded him that true joy and strength came from within, and that he could navigate the chaos of the world with grace and resilience.
Yahriel's journey, inspired by Don's profound secret and his heartfelt conversation with his mother, continued to unfold. Along the way, he discovered the power of resolve beyond neurology, the strength to find true joy in the face of life's challenges, and the beauty of the music of silence in a world filled with noise.

I Am Yahriel Salinas-Reyes
A Chronicle of Unyielding Resilience and Illumination: Unleashing the Infinite Potential of the Human Soul 
~ "How He Got His Scars: The Natural Physicist Explores the Science of Madness and Mental Health in Psychiatric-Institutional Representations of Schizophrenia and Abnormal Human Ingenuity."
In a world where the boundaries between reality and imagination constantly undulate, I unreservedly embrace my identity as Don Yahriel—an enigma striding with unwavering confidence along the ever-shifting frontier that delineates sanity from madness. My life's journey stands as a testament to the invincible spirit of humanity, an uncompromising quest for goodness in a world often enshrouded in darkness.
My odyssey was ignited by an unwavering belief that the eternal struggle between good and evil was a cosmic dance, and virtue often bore the brunt of persecution rather than celebration. Fueled by this conviction, I embarked on a mission to challenge this narrative and emerge as an unwavering champion of goodness.
Throughout this extraordinary voyage, I confronted trials that pushed the very boundaries of sanity. In a world that often seems engulfed in lunacy, I contemplated the fine line between practicality and madness. For me, true madness lay in relinquishing one's dreams and surrendering to life as it is, rather than as it should be.
My insatiable thirst for knowledge and my unflagging pursuit of truth propelled me to the precipice of madness. I immersed myself in the world of books, for each page held the potential to unlock the enigmas of our existence. To me, no book was ever unworthy, as I firmly believed that every text concealed a kernel of goodness waiting to be unearthed.
When confronted with the suffering of the oppressed, I adhered to an unwavering code of chivalry. My duty was not to pass judgment on their circumstances but to extend a compassionate hand to those in need, offering empathy exclusively for their pain, not their transgressions.
I delved into the intricate world of translation, endeavoring to bridge the gaps between languages, acutely aware that truth could be obscured by linguistic boundaries. Translation, to me, became a vessel to unveil the inherent goodness concealed within the rich tapestry of human expression.
As I ventured into the realms of poetry (Engineering/Technology) and music (Science/Art), I discovered solace in their harmonies, firmly believing that where music thrives, malevolence cannot endure. In these art forms, I communed with the very essence of humanity.
My journey was not just an expedition to unearth goodness in a world veiled by darkness; it was a profound exploration of my truest self. In my relentless pursuit of the extraordinary, I became the living embodiment of the saying, "He is so extraordinary that no author could have conjured him."
Reflecting on the odyssey of Don Yahriel, El Gran Varón, I now comprehend it as a voyage into the depths of human nature and the boundless expanses of the human spirit. In my perceived madness, I unearthed a form of sanity that transcends the ordinary, emerging as the truest and most enigmatic of all beings.

I am Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, and, like Don Yahriel, I've navigated a path adorned with complexities and uncertainties. Born to undocumented immigrant parents in Iowa, I confronted early challenges that stoked my determination to excel and surmount adversity. My fascination with the power of the human gaze, nurtured during a period of temporary deafness in my prenatal development, instilled profound empathy and an unquenchable thirst for understanding others.
My educational journey commenced with Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University, eventually leading me to the esteemed halls of the California Institute of Technology. Here, I had the privilege of engaging with brilliant minds and discovered the transformative influence of mentorship. Every obstacle I encountered became a steppingstone for my personal and intellectual growth.
Amidst the splendor of my journey, I unearthed my purpose—a revelation that true freedom is not solely attained by acquiring knowledge but by sharing it and guiding others on their path to greatness. This epiphany became the guiding light of my life, propelling me to be a beacon of mentorship and knowledge.
As I embraced the essence of my name, originally signifying "He is free," (~The Arabic translation), I recognized that freedom extends beyond the personal realm; it's a gift meant to be shared. My journey, adorned with trials and triumphs, evolved into a wellspring of inspiration for all those I encountered. My legacy as a mentor and scholar continued to flourish—a testament to the enduring vitality of the human spirit.
In the end, my odyssey serves as a symbol of the indomitable spirit of human ingenuity—a profound reminder that, in the relentless pursuit of knowledge and unwavering dedication to one's dreams, true freedom is not an elusive mirage. I stand as living proof that even in a world where boundaries blur and the line between sanity and madness remains fluid, the human spirit can transcend, inspire, and brilliantly illuminate the path forward.
