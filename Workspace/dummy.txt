Statement of Grant Purpose Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, Host Country: Mexico, Field: Molecular & Systems Bioengineering Project Title: Unraveling the Molecular Code of Natural Antidepressants in Grapes In the ever-evolving world of scientific inquiry, certain moments emerge as profound intersections of human ingenuity, scientific inquiry, and the enigmatic wonders of nature. Encapsulated within this project is one such moment. With a central focus on unraveling the molecular code of grapes to find the compounds responsible for its potential natural antidepressant properties, Yahriel Salinas-Reyes aims to foster innovation in treatments for mental health disorders and conditions. Also encompassed in the project is an investigation into the nature of schizophrenia and the complexities of neuroplasticity, in hopes of advancing understanding of the mental illness. The overarching goal is to address the mounting global health crisis presented by mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, which have surged to an unprecedented global health crisis significantly diminishing the quality of life for millions and placing immense pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. At its core, the project is driven by the ambition to conduct a comprehensive molecular analysis of grapes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of antioxidants. Grapes have garnered scientific interest due to their potential health benefits and their recent recognition as potential natural antidepressants. Yahriel's unique background in aerospace engineering and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) equips him with the precision and expertise required to delve into the microscopic realm of chromosomes and molecules—an essential prerequisite for unveiling the genetic secrets grapes hold. To fulfill the project's objectives, advanced techniques in molecular biology and biotechnology systems engineering will be employed. The primary goal is to pinpoint the specific compounds within grapes responsible for their potential antidepressant properties, involving their isolation and characterization to illuminate their mechanisms of action within the brain. The aim is to identify practical applications for mental health treatment by comprehending the genetic and molecular foundation of natural antidepressant production in grapes. Concurrently, this research adopts a multifaceted approach to unravel the complexities of schizophrenia, a debilitating and chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and cognitive deficits. At the heart of schizophrenia's enduring enigma are Bleuler's four A's: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, and Affect blunting. Extensive research has explored the etiology of schizophrenia, leading to the emergence of three prominent theories: genetic, neurodevelopmental, and neurobiological. Each theory offers a distinct perspective on the origins of this complex disorder, making it challenging to pinpoint a single causative factor. Nonetheless, neurobiological theory has gained prominence due to its comprehensive approach, explaining schizophrenia as a result of abnormal brain dysfunctions or structural anomalies. This theory stands on solid scientific ground, holds promise in guiding treatment strategies, transcends cultural and demographic boundaries, and raises fewer ethical concerns compared to alternative theories. Structural and functional abnormalities in key brain systems (i.e., the prefrontal & medial temporal lobes) play a pivotal role in the manifestation of schizophrenia symptoms that are integral to working memory and declarative memory processes. The disrupted functioning contributes to cognitive impairments and emotional dysregulation in individuals with schizophrenia. In the quest to understand schizophrenia, neuroplasticity—the brain's remarkable capacity to adapt and reorganize itself in Salinas-Reyes, Statement of Grant Purpose, Page 2 response to learning, experiences, and environmental changes—emerges as a crucial factor operating at various levels, from synaptic plasticity, where the strength of connections between neurons is modified, to large-scale changes in brain structure and function. In the context of schizophrenia, neuroplasticity offers hope for improving cognitive functioning and overall quality of life for affected individuals. Research has shown that cognitive remediation therapies— which harness neuroplasticity—can lead to improvements in cognitive domains such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, mitigating some of the cognitive impairments associated with the disorder. This project is founded on the belief that nature holds the key to addressing complex health challenges, including mental health disorders like depression and schizophrenia, and seeks to explore the potential of grapes as a source of natural antidepressants.. One intriguing entry point into the complex world of grape biochemistry is through the study of yeast used in wine production, which plays a pivotal role in the fermentation process, and influences the composition of compounds within grapes. Scientific evidence unveiled that certain molecular compounds in the antioxidants act as natural antidepressants but there lacks initiative to utilize these antioxidant agents in psychiatric institutions and practical methods. By employing advanced techniques such as neuroimaging, fractal geometry, and spectral analysis, the project aims to unveil underlying patterns and causative factors associated with depression and related mental health conditions. The significance of this research extends far beyond the development of new treatments. It encompasses a broader understanding of the intricate relationship between food, biochemistry, and mental health. This knowledge has the potential to inform dietary recommendations that promote mental well-being, potentially reducing the global prevalence of these disorders. Yahriel, and the research team at the university Tecnológico de Monterrey endeavor to decode the molecular secrets of nature to improve the human condition, particularly for individuals affected by schizophrenia and other mental health disorders. Yahriel's work represents a convergence of scientific rigor, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a profound commitment to the betterment of human well-being. Furthermore, this research holds the potential to strengthen international collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico. By conducting research at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Yahriel can contribute to the exchange of knowledge and ideas between the two countries, fostering a stronger global community which reflects the essence of the Fulbright mission, emphasizing mutual understanding and collaboration between nations. Yahriel Salinas-Reyes' Fulbright-Garcia Robles Open Study/Research Award proposal represents a unique and ambitious endeavor to explore the natural antidepressant properties of grapes. Grounded in the principles of interdisciplinary research, this project not only has the potential to transform mental health treatment but also to deepen our understanding of the brain's plasticity. It is a testament to the power of collaboration and cultural exchange in the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of human well-being. Yahriel's unwavering commitment to utilizing opportunities to their fullest and to serve as a cultural diplomat, bridging gaps between different fields and nations, promises to unlock the molecular code of nature and take meaningful strides toward a healthier and more fulfilling world for all. Yahriel's proposal represents a remarkable opportunity to weave together science, innovation, and compassion in the quest to decipher the extraordinary truths hidden within the universe's code
