Nature’s Chaos Game: An Existentialist Approach Informed by Mathematics and Neurobiology
Introduction: Mental health disorders represent a profound challenge to contemporary society, impacting millions of lives worldwide. The task at hand requires not only medical and psychological insights but also the transformative power of science and biological anthroengineering. This proposed research operates at the crossroads of diverse scientific disciplines, with two primary objectives: first, to decode the intricate neurobiological landscape of schizophrenia, and second, to uncover the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of potential natural antidepressants found in grapes. Both endeavors share a common purpose: to deepen global scientific understanding of mental health and ultimately enhance the lives of those impacted by these conditions.
Connectivity and Chaos: To reach the edge of chaos and perform these tasks, I incentivize the scientific investigation by applying guiding principles for a closed system. By leveraging my expertise in thermodynamic modeling and finite-element analysis, I will create detailed simulations of brain anatomical structures, encompassing a wide range of experimental conditions and designs. Let 𝛴 be a smooth oriented surface that is bounded, 𝜕𝛴 ≡ 𝛤; then, we invoke boundary conditions. Furthermore, entropy, represented by 𝑆, is a measure of morphology or order in the system, 𝜕𝑆 ≡ 𝑁; I validate this mathematical theorem with the second set of equations. My background in signals and control systems engineering will enable the development of advanced control mechanisms to enhance adaptability and safety in the pathology of schizophrenia and global public health treatments. Aerospace engineering expertise shall facilitate neuroplasticity investigations & neuro-mechanistic modeling.
Governing Equations: [1] Energy: 𝛷𝐸 = ∯ 𝐸 ⋅ ⅆ𝐴, [2] Mobility: ∬ (𝛻 × 𝐹) ⋅ ⅆ𝛴 𝛴 = ∮ 𝐹 ⋅ ⅆ𝛤 𝜕𝛴 , and [3] Continuity: ∭ (𝛻 ⋅ 𝐹) ⅆ𝑉 𝑉 = ∯ (𝐹 ⋅ 𝑛̂) ⋅ ⅆ𝑆 𝑆.
Chaos Theory: [4] Chaos-Game: 𝑥𝑛+1 = 𝜆𝑥𝑛 (1 − 𝑥𝑛 ), [5] Mandelbrot-Set: 𝑍𝑛+1 = 𝑍𝑛 2 + 𝐶, and [6] Fractals: 𝐷 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑁 / 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑆.
Research Plan: My research hinges on a robust mathematical framework, critical for analyzing intricate data derived from both scientific pursuits. The application of Monte Carlo Integration, Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometry of Nature, and artificial intelligence techniques empowers us to model and analyze the intricate data from these two distinct yet interconnected research streams. The research plan will unfold over five years:
1.	Year 1: Data collection and establishment of the research framework.
