Nature’s Chaos Game: An Existentialist Approach Informed by Mathematics and Neurobiology

Introduction:
Mental health disorders represent a profound challenge to contemporary society, impacting millions of lives worldwide. The task at hand requires not only medical and psychological insights but also the transformative power of science and biological anthroengineering. This proposed research operates at the crossroads of diverse scientific disciplines, with two primary objectives: first, to decode the intricate neurobiological landscape of schizophrenia, and second, to uncover the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the synthesis of potential natural antidepressants found in grapes.

Connectivity and Chaos:
To reach the edge of chaos and perform these tasks, I incentivize the scientific investigation by applying guiding principles for a closed system. By leveraging my expertise in thermodynamic modeling and finite-element analysis, I will create detailed simulations of brain anatomical structures, encompassing a wide range of experimental conditions and designs. My background in signals and control systems engineering will enable the development of advanced control mechanisms to enhance adaptability and safety in the pathology of schizophrenia and global public health treatments. Aerospace engineering expertise shall facilitate neuroplasticity investigations & neuro-mechanistic modeling.
