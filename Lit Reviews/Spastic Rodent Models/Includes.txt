INCLUDES FROM DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS:
I am designing experiments that are based on the research project narrative of this document here:{https://github.com/yahriels/yahriels/blob/main/Workspace/ProjectNarrative_VeHROC%20v3.pdf} with this following information:{Research Question: Can VeHROC, a novel therapy combining HROC and VNS, more effectively improve recovery of hindlimb function compared to HROC or VNS alone in a rat model of chronic incomplete SCI?

This project and set of experiments is inspired on the pre-clinical model of this paper: 
Motor learning changes the axon initial segment of the spinal motoneuron (Link: https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP283875)

This project and set of experiments is heavily motivated and will be applied in the same manner with the goal of translational therapy such as these two papers below.
