Prompts for Literature Review:{“Can you provide an overview of the main theories and concepts related to [your research topic]?”

“What are the current trends and developments in [your research field]?”

“Can you suggest some key studies or research papers on [specific aspect of your research topic]?”

“What are the main methodologies used in conducting research on [your research topic]?”

“Can you provide a critical analysis of the existing literature on [your research question]?”

“Are there any gaps or areas of controversy in the literature on [your research topic] that need further exploration?”

“What are the key findings and conclusions from the most recent studies on [your research topic]?”

“Can you suggest some reputable journals or publications explore for relevant literature in [your research field]?”

“What are the different perspectives or schools of thought in the literature on [your research topic]?”

“Can you provide a summary of the historical background and evolution of research on [your research topic]?”}



Key aspects of critical thinking
• Identify evidence to back-up AND challenge key points
• Detecting inconsistencies and mistakes in authors’ reasoning
• Detecting bias, premature conclusions, lacking evidence
• Distinguishing between fact and opinion
• Evaluating conflicting opinions/research
• Suggesting new or different solutions
• Constructing your own arguments and opinions

What should I be asking?
• Why is the author choosing to use the evidence presented?
• Is there a hidden agenda?
• Are the sources reliable and objective?
• Is there bias present?
• Have all of the points been cited?
• Is there information missing?
• Are there conflicting opinions/conclusions?
And most importantly….

1. "Help me strike the right balance between providing enough detail to engage readers and avoiding unnecessary jargon in my writing."
2. "Assist me in constructing an engaging opening hook that captures reader's attention and introduces my research."
3." Guide me in formulating clear aims and objectives for my study by suggesting a list of verbs I can choose from."




My writing feels scrappy and fragmented. Can you give me some specific words and phrases I can use to connect the sections together and integrate the material, so it flows better? They should be fill in the gap sentence starters. Please give me 10.


For improving overall quality of your text:
- Provide a critique of this text from the point of view of someone who doesn't believe the argument made here about [insert your argument]?
- Can you peer-review this text for me in a way that specifically looks out for problems with logical argumentation?
- Propose a better structure for rewriting what I have already written so that the reader can better follow the flow of my arguments?

Paragraph-specific prompts for structure & flow:
- Rewrite this paragraph to enhance its argumentative tone and structure in a way that it leads to highlighting the [insert key message/argument you are trying to get across]?
- I want to reduce the awkwardness of this paragraph. Can you rewrite it in a way that enhances its fluidity without changing the original message? Keep the references. (ESL specific)
- I’m struggling with the transition between these two paragraphs, where I move from discussing [insert aim of paragraph 1] to [insert aim of paragraph 2]. Suggest a smoother transition that enhances the flow?

For assisting you with individual sentences/phrases:
- Can you simplify this sentence without oversimplifying the technical details?
- All my sentences seem to start the same way in this text. Help me rephrase this one to start differently?
- I’m struggling to integrate this quotation [insert quote and author/year] naturally in this broader paragraph. Can you do a seamless integration of this quote into this specific sentence?
- Can you adjust the tone of this sentence to sound more [insert tone]? (Tones commonly used in academic texts: analytical, argumentative, persuasive, questioning, authoritative, explanatory, reflective, speculative, assertive)
