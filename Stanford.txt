Degree Program

Neurosciences (PhD)
The program you selected is one of the 14 Home Programs offered under Biosciences.

The Stanford Biosciences is an umbrella program that provides a single application and unified graduate training across a range of disciplines in biology and biomedical research. The Biosciences program encourages students to explore research opportunities, carry out rotations, and choose dissertation research in any of the 14 Home Programs. Each student is admitted to a particular Home Program, which then provides a primary academic base. Your program selection should be based on the alignment of your interests with a program's faculty, and the specifics of the program curriculum. Regardless of your Home Program, you have full access to faculty in all of the other Home Programs for laboratory rotations and potential thesis work.

You are able to select one alternative Home Program. Only select a program if you have a genuine interest. Including a poorly matched program will not necessarily increase your chances of being accepted.
