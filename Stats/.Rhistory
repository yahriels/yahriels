# 5. Interpret R Output: Focus on p-value, F-value, df
## Outputs from ANOVA: P-value=0.03, MSBetween=21407, MSWithin=111711, F-Value=3.641, df=19.
# Interpretation: If the p-value from the ANOVA is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. As we can see that the P-value is less than 0.05, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and can visually see that agent two has a different spread and behavior from the rest of the agents.
# 6. Decision: Based on the p-value from ANOVA
print(anova_summary)
cat("We verified our assumptions that this data set it normal (Shapiro) and that it had homogenous variance (levene) since those p-values where greater than 0.05. For our conclusion we look at the ANOVA summary. Since thehe p-value (0.03) from the ANOVA is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in the increase of blood beta-carotene levels among the agents.\n")
# 7. Conclusion in Context:
cat("Based on the analysis performed (ANOVA, Shapiro, Levene) with a anove p-value of 0.03, we conclude that the type of agent used significantly affects the change in blood beta-carotene levels.\n")
# 8. Study Power Analysis: Calculate study power assuming n=6 per group and effect size = 0.25
power_analysis <- pwr.anova.test(k = 4, n = 6, f = 0.25, sig.level = 0.05)
print(power_analysis) # Output results of Power Analysis
# 9. Post-Hoc Analysis: Perform Tukey's HSD to see specific group differences if ANOVA is significant
## Even though from our ANOVA test we see that the p-value is less than 0.05, therefore we will still run Post-Hoc as instructed.
post_hoc <- TukeyHSD(anova_model)
print(post_hoc)
# 10. Conclusion After Post-Hoc Analysis: Summarize which groups are significantly different
cat("The post-hoc analysis shows that agent 2 differs significantly from agent 1 (p < 0.05). Other pairwise comparisons do not show significant differences which can be verified visually in step 2 by the box plots, as well as the post-hoc test where any matched pair that includes '2' has a significantly higher magnitude and different spread, than the rest of the matched pairs. \n")
