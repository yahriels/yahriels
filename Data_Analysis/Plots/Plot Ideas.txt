This Idea takes any measureable/controllable qualitys or quantitys of a sample space or the "Scientific Landscape" and reduces our highly contoured and covariate problems/data and simplifies it to low-order problems to guide our design making whilst not only saving, but optimizing our efforts to exert our influence,interact,integrate,or build a system architecture by learning from the Scientific Landscape of the Natural
