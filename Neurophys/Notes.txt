Li et al. (2016) "Adaptive coding of sound intensity in the auditory cortex of awake mice" Nature Communications, 7, 12320 [Non-source information - Example of a likely citing paper]: This hypothetical paper likely employs dense electrophysiological recordings to map sound intensity coding across different auditory cortical areas in awake mice, similar to Polley et al.'s use of microelectrode mapping. It might also use spatial clustering methods to identify regions with distinct intensity coding properties and potentially employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the significance of these spatial distributions by comparing them to randomized data. This work would likely cite Polley et al. as a key study that comprehensively mapped multiple functional properties, including intensity tuning (monotonicity and best level), across several auditory fields in another rodent model (the rat), providing a comparative framework and methodological precedent.

O'Connell et al. (2011) "Circuit-level computations underlying auditory scene analysis" Nature Neuroscience, 14(10), 1331-1339 [Non-source information - Example of a likely citing paper]: This hypothetical paper might investigate the functional organization of the auditory cortex in rats or mice in the context of processing complex sounds relevant to auditory scene analysis. It could use electrophysiological recordings across multiple auditory fields and analyze the spatial patterns of neural responses to different sound features. Similar to Polley et al., it might employ spatial clustering techniques to identify functionally distinct regions and potentially use Monte Carlo analyses to determine if the observed spatial organization of response properties (e.g., selectivity to specific sound features) is non-random. This study would likely cite Polley et al. for its detailed mapping of multiple auditory fields and the demonstration of non-topographic spatial organization of receptive field properties, establishing the groundwork for understanding how such organization might contribute to more complex auditory processing.

Functional Organization of the Rat Auditory Cortex This study mapped five tonotopically organized auditory fields—AI, AAF, PAF, VAF, and SRAF—using high-density microelectrode recordings and tracer injections. It confirmed the relative positions of all five fields and established VAF as a distinct auditory area based on unique thalamic inputs and response properties.
Spatial Clustering of Functional Properties Beyond tonotopy, receptive field parameters (e.g., tuning sharpness, intensity-response, and temporal properties) exhibited nonrandom spatial clustering, sometimes extending across tonotopic boundaries, suggesting an additional organizational structure.
Monte Carlo Analysis of Spatial Structure Simulations comparing real and randomized distributions showed significant spatial structuring of receptive field properties, with AI and AAF exhibiting the strongest clustering, while VAF and SRAF had more diffuse organization, highlighting functional distinctions among cortical fields.
