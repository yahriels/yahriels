Before you get started we want to make sure that you understand the requirements of the GEM Fellowship program. If you have not done so already Please read About the GEM Fellowship.
> I understand that I am applying for funding for graduate school in an engineering or applied science field that if selected, funding will begin no earlier than the following Fall.
> I understand that after I complete all parts of the on-line GEM application that my application is not complete until I submit complete applications directly to 3 GEM Member universities' (unless currently in a Master’s or PhD program with at least one year left) science or engineering graduate department by their respective posted deadlines.
> I understand that I must be available to intern with my sponsoring company for the summer before I begin my PhD or if I am an entering Master’s student the summer before I begin my program and the summer after my first year (2 internships in total, continuing Master’s/PhD students with at least one-year left must do at least 1 internship).

 [11] Recommendations
 Your GEM application requires two recommendations to move forward in the process; yet THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED for a competitive application. Preferably, recommenders should be at least TWO faculty members, and a technical industry management professional holding a STEM graduate degree may serve as the third recommendation in place of a faculty member. Ensure that all recommenders will provide a STRONG recommendation on your behalf.
