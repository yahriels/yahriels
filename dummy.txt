Panelists evaluating applications may consider the following with respect to the Intellectual 
Merit Criterion: the potential of the applicant to advance knowledge based on a holistic analysis 
of the complete application, including the personal statement, relevant background, future 
goals, graduate research statement, strength of academic record, description of previous 
research experience or publication/presentations, and references. Panelists may consider the 
following with respect to the Broader Impacts Criterion: the potential of the applicant for future 
broader impacts as indicated by personal experiences, professional experiences, educational 
experiences and future plans. Here is how I like to think of the review criteria, point by point. 
How would answering this research question change science (Intellectual Merit) or society 
(Broader Impacts)? Why should I fund you specifically, and not just this research question? What 
innovation do you specifically bring to the table? Is there a detailed plan? With built in measures 
of success? What are your qualifications? Can you actual carry out the needed research? At the 
end of each essay, you should be able to check off how you answered each point above for 
BOTH Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.
