## By Yahriel Salinas-Reyes [Y.Salinas-Reyes]
# An Existentialist Approach Informed by Numbers, Shapes, and Prediction
An Approach to Unraveling The Science of Madness (Schizophrenia) and Human Ingenuity for Global Health, Inspired by with Bleuler's 4A'sPrimary Traits of Schizophrenia and The Dividided Self: Alogia, Autism, Ambivalence, Affect Blunting


**Subject Opinion:**
In today's rapidly changing world, we often struggle to understand the present before it becomes the past. This proposal aims to shed light on the function of madness and chaos, not to undermine its toll on individuals, but to unravel the problem it is meant to solve. Building upon R.D. Laing's revolutionary theory that schizophrenia arises from the battle between our imposed identity and our authentic self, this research explores the possibility of insanity and confusion as a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. Laing theorised that insanity could be understood as a reaction to the divided self. Instead of arising as a purely medical disease or psychotic behaviors (i.e. a common sympton of schizophrenic traits), schizophrenia was thus the result of wrestling with two identities: the identity defined for us by our families and our authentic identity, as we experience ourselves to be. When the two are fundamentally different, it triggers an internal fracturing of the self. Comprehensively, the label of Madness and Confusion is defined as a naturally sane reaction to an insane world in the words of R.D. Laing. By applying the concepts of entropy and chaos theory to model the dynamics of social-behavioral systems, we aim to study schizophrenia/psychosis and other neurological abnormalities, morphologies, and ingenuity of the human brain.

Despite the initial controversy surrounding Laing's existential perspective, there is immense value in delving into the personal, interpretive, and small-scale aspects often overlooked in traditional psychiatric narratives. We propose utilizing a fundamental method of studying neurobiological dysfunctions and abnormal functions/morphologies of the schizophrenic brain. This will help uncover correlations and causalities between the active phase-matter in schizophrenic traits and other related disorders.

The motivation behind this study stems from the world's failure to effectively utilize the groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, global public health, and social sciences. Through rigorous research and the development of a scientific method backed by advanced instrumentation, our objective is to provide foundational evidence for a clinical social understanding of schizophrenia and its related traits. This paradigm shift, rooted in biomedical-analytical and logical-mathematical scientific theory, will facilitate the advancement of global public health.

> Yahriel is a "Universal Man" with knowledge and experience in many disciplines. Yahriel is a decorated champion of his community and today he finds work as a scientific researcher of nature physics and experimental systems engineering and is in pursuit of a PhD. Born in Iowa to undocumented immigrant parents, Yahriel had a unique experience and set of challenges growing up as he navigated a foreign society with no instructions included.

> Was Albert Einstein born a genius, or did a fateful encounter result in the greatness of Einstein as we know him today? Yahriel Salinas-Reyes, an inquisitive youngster with a passionate and unruly mind, ascended through the **Aerospace Engineering program at Iowa State University of Science and Technology(Class of '23)** and eventually journeyed to the empire of Einstein at the California Institute of Technology (where Albert Einstein taught). Yahriel walked the same halls Albert Einstein once did and engaged some of the world's most powerful minds at work.

> Yahriel had undertaken a number of different projects and work environments, but nothing could have prepared him for the new world he had just stepped into. While Yahriel experienced every challenge and emotion possible, it enabled him to see the collateral beauty of his journey as he discovered the influential power of mentorship and glimpsed the truth of human ingenuity.
